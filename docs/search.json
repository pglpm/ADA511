    "text": "Science is built up with facts, as a house is with stones. But a collection of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house.     (H. Poincaré)\n\nPreface\n**WARNING: THIS IS A WORKING DRAFT. TEXT WILL CHANGE A LOT. MANY PASSAGES ARE JUST TEMPORARY, INCOHERENT, AND DISJOINTED.\nTo be written.\n\nDifference between car mechanic and automotive engineer\n“Engineering based on data” is just how engineering and science in general have been in the past 400 years or so. Nothing new there.\nThe amount of available data has changed. This may lead to a reduction – or in some cases an increase – in uncertainty, and therefore to different solutions.\nLuckily the fundamental theory to deal with large amount of data is exactly the same to deal with small amounts. So the foundations haven’t changed.\n\nThis course makes you acquainted with the foundations.\n\nMany results of science that we readily believe are in fact quite extraordinary claims. Take a moment to reflect on how unbelievable the following propositions would have appeared to a keen and intelligent observer of nature from 500 years ago. The earth is very old, well over 4 billion years of age; it exists in a near-vacuum and revolves around the sun, which is about 150 million kilometers away; in the sun a great deal of energy is produced by nuclear fusion, the same kind of process as the explosion of a hydrogen bomb; all material objects are made up of invisible molecules and atoms, which are in turn made up of elementary particles, all far too small ever to be seen or felt directly; in each cell of a living creature there is a hypercomplex molecule called DNA, which largely determines the shape and functioning of the organism; and so on. Most members of today’s educated public subscribing to the “Western” civilization would assent to most of these propositions without hesitation, teach them confidently to their children, and become indignant when some ignorant people question these truths. However, if they were asked to say why they believe these items of scientific common sense, most would be unable to produce any convincing arguments. It may even be that the more basic and firm the belief is, the more stumped we tend to feel in trying to justify it. Such a correlation would indicate that unquestioning belief has served as a substitute for genuine understanding.\n\n\nIt is neither desirable nor any longer effective to try bullying people into accepting the authority of science. Instead, all members of the educated public can be invited to participate in science, in order to experience the true nature and value of scientific inquiry. This does not mean listening to professional scientists tell condescending stories about how they have discovered wonderful things, which you should believe for reasons that are too difficult for you to understand in real depth and detail. Doing science ought to mean asking your own questions, making your own investigations, and drawing your own conclusions for your own reasons. Of course it will not be feasible to advance the “cutting edge” or “frontier”” of modern science without first acquiring years of specialist training. However, the cutting edge is not all there is to science, nor is it necessarily the most valuable part of science. Questions that have been answered are still worth asking again, so you can understand for yourself how to arrive at the standard answers, and possibly discover new answers or recover forgotten answers that are valuable."

    "text": "\\[\n\\DeclarePairedDelimiters{\\set}{\\{}{\\}}\n\\]\n\nLet’s start with a question that could arise in a particular engineering problem:\n\nA particular kind of electronic component is produced on an assembly line. At the end of the line, there is an automated inspection device that works as follows with every newly produced component coming out of the line.\nThe inspection device first makes some tests on the new component. The tests give an uncertain forecast of whether that component will fail within its first year of use, or after.\nThen the device decides whether the component is accepted and packaged for sale, or discarded and thrown away.\nWhen a new electronic component is sold, the manufacturer has a net gain of \\(1\\$\\). If the component fails within a year of use, however, the manufacturer incur net loss of \\(11\\$\\) (12$ loss, minus the 1$ gained at first), owing to warranty refunds and damage costs to be paid to the buyer. When a new electronic component is discarded, the manufacturer has \\(0\\$\\) net gain.\nFor a specific new electronic component, just come out of the assembly line, the tests of the automated inspection device indicate that there is a \\(10\\%\\) probability that the component will fail within its first year of use.\n\n\n\n\nShould the inspection device accept or discard the new component?\n\nFirst, try to give and motivate an answer.\nThis is not the real question of this exercise, however. In fact it doesn’t matter if you don’t get the correct answer; not even if you don’t manage to get an answer at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Very first exercise!\n\n\n\nThe purpose here is for you to do some introspection about your own reasoning. Then examine and discuss these points:\n\nWhich numerical elements in the problem seem to affect the answer?\nCan these numerical elements be clearly separated? How would you separate them?\nHow would the answer change, if these numerical elements were changed? Feel free to change them, also in extreme ways, and see how the answer would change.\nCould we solve the problem if we didn’t have the probabilities? Why?\nCould we solve the problem if we didn’t know the various gains and losses? Why?\nCan this problem be somehow abstracted, and then transformed into another one with completely different details? For instance, consider translating along these lines:\n\ninspection device → computer pilot of self-driving car\ntests → camera image\nfail within a year → pedestrian in front of car\naccept/discard → keep on going/ break"

    "section": "2.1 What does the intro problem tell us?",
    "text": "2.1 What does the intro problem tell us?\nLet’s approach the “accept or discard?” problem of the previous chapter 1 in an intuitive way.\n\n\nWe’re jumping the gun here, because we haven’t learned the method to solve this problem yet!\nFirst let’s say that we accept the component. What happens?\nWe must try to make sense of that \\(10\\%\\) probability that the component fails within a year. Different people do this with different imagination tricks. We can imagine, for instance, that this situation is repeated 100 times. In 10 of these repetitions the accepted electronic component is sold and fails within a year after selling. In the remaining 90 repetitions, the component is sold and works fine for at least a year.\nIn each of the 10 imaginary repetitions in which the component fails early, the manufacturer loses \\(11\\$\\). That’s a total loss of \\(10 \\cdot 11\\$ = 110\\$\\). In each of the 90 imaginary repetitions in which the component doesn’t fail early, the manufacturer gains \\(1\\$\\). That’s a total gain of \\(90\\$\\). So over all 100 imaginary repetitions the manufacturer gains\n\\[\n10\\cdot (-11\\$) + 90\\cdot 1\\$ = {\\color[RGB]{238,102,119}-20\\$} \\ ,\n\\]\nthat is, the manufacturer has not gained, but lost \\(20\\$\\) ! That’s an average of \\(0.2\\$\\) lost per repetition.\nNow let’s say that we discard the component instead. What happens? In this case we don’t need to invoke imaginary repetitions, but even if we do, it’s clear that the manufacturer doesn’t gain or lose anything – that is, the “gain” is \\(0\\$\\) – in each and all of the repetitions.\nThe conclusion is that if in a situation like this we accept the component, then we’ll lose \\(0.2\\$\\) on average; whereas if we discard it, then on average we won’t lose anything or gain anything.\nObviously the best, or “least worst”, decision to make is to discard the component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercises\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have an idea of the general reasoning, check what happens with different values of the probability of failure and of the failure cost: is it still best to discard? For instance, try with\n\nfailure probability 10% and failure cost 5$;\nfailure probability 5% and failure cost 11$;\nfailure probability 10%, failure cost 11$, non-failure gain 2$.\n\nFeel free to get wild and do plots.\nIdentify the failure probability at which accepting the component doesn’t lead to any loss or any gain, so it doesn’t matter whether we discard or accept. (You can solve this as you prefer: analytically with an equation, visually with a plot, by trial & error on several cases, or whatnot.)\nConsider the special case with failure probability 0% and failure cost 10$. This means no new component will ever fail. To decide in such a case we do not need imaginary repetitions; but confirm that we arrive at the same logical conclusion whether we reason through imaginary repetitions or not.\nConsider this completely different problem:\n\nA patient is examined by a brand-new medical diagnostics AI system.\nThe AI first performs some clinical tests on the patient. The tests give an uncertain forecast of whether the patient has a particular disease or not.\nThen the AI decides whether the patient should be dismissed without treatment, or treated with a particular medicine.\nIf the patient is dismissed, then the life expectancy doesn’t increase or decrease if the disease is not present, but it decreases by 10 years if the disease is actually present. If the patient is treated, then the life expectancy decreases by 1 year if the disease is not present (owing to treatment side-effects), but also if the disease is present (because it cures the disease, so the life expectancy doesn’t decrease by 10 years; but it still decreases by 1 year owing to the side effects).\nFor this patient, the clinical tests indicate that there is a \\(10\\%\\) probability that the patient has the disease.\n\nShould the diagnostic AI dismiss or treat the patient? Find differences and similarities, even numerical, with the assembly-line problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the solution of the problem and from the exploring exercises, we gather some instructive points:\n\nIs it enough if we simply know that the component is less likely to fail than not? in other words, if we simply know that the probability of failure is less than \\(50\\%\\)?\nObviously not. We found that if the failure probability is \\(10\\%\\) then it’s best to discard; but if it’s \\(5\\%\\) then it’s best to accept. In both cases the component was less likely to fail than not, but the decisions were different. Moreover, we found that the probability affected the loss if one made the non-optimal decision. Therefore:\nKnowledge of exact probabilities is absolutely necessary for making the best decision\nIs it enough if we simply know that failure leads to a cost? that is, that its gain is less than the gain for non-failure?\nObviously not. The situation is similar to that with the probability. In the exercise we found that if the failure cost is \\(11\\$\\) then it’s best to discard; but if it’s \\(5\\$\\) then it’s best to accept. It’s also best to accept if the failure cost is \\(11\\$\\) but the non-failure gain is \\(2\\$\\). Therefore:\nKnowledge of the exact gains and losses is absolutely necessary for making the best decision\nIs this kind of decision situation only relevant to assembly lines and sales?\nBy all means not. We found a clinical situation that’s exactly analogous: there’s uncertainty, there are gains and losses (of time rather than money), and the best decision depends on both."

    "section": "2.2 Our focus: decision-making, inference, and data science",
    "text": "2.2 Our focus: decision-making, inference, and data science\nEvery data-driven engineering project is unique, with its unique difficulties and problems. But there are also problems common to all engineering projects.\nIn the scenarios we explored above, we found an extremely important problem-pattern. There is a decision or choice to make (and “not deciding” is not an option – or it’s just another kind choice). Making a particular decision will lead to some consequences, some leading to a desired goal, others leading to something undesirable. The decision is difficult because its consequences are not known with certainty, given the information and data available in the problem. We may lack information and data about past or present details, about future events and responses, and so on. This is what we call a problem of decision-making under uncertainty or under risk1, or simply a “decision problem” for short.1 We’ll avoid the word “risk” because it has several different technical meanings in the literature, some even contradictory.\nThis problem-pattern appears literally everywhere. But our explored scenarios also suggest that this problem-pattern has a sort of systematic solution method.\nIn this course we’re going to focus on decision problems and their systematic solution method. We’ll learn a framework and some abstract notions that allow us to frame and analyse this kind of problem, and we’ll learn a universal set of principles to solve it. This set of principles goes under the name of Decision Theory. \nBut what do decision-making under uncertainty and Decision Theory have to do with data and data science? The three are profoundly and tightly related on many different planes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For the extra curious\n\n\n\nDecision theory in expert systems and artificial intelligence\n\n\n\nWe saw that probability values are essential in a decision problem. How do we find them? As you can imagine, data play an important part in their calculation. In our intro example, the failure probability must come from observations or experiments on similar electronic components.\nWe saw that also the values of gains and losses are essential. Data play an important part in their calculation as well.\nData science is based on the laws of Decision Theory. Here’s an analogy: a rocket engineer relies on fundamental physical laws (balance of momentum, energy, and so on) for making a rocket work. Failure to account for those laws leads at best to sub-optimal solutions, at worst to disasters. As we shall see, the same is true for a data scientist and the rules of decision theory.\nMachine-learning algorithms, in particular, are realizations or approximations of the rules of Decision Theory. This is clear, for instance, considering that the main task of a machine-learning classifier is to decide among possible output labels or classes.\nThe rules of Decision Theory are also the foundations upon which artificial-intelligence agents, which must make optimal inferences and decisions, are built.\n\nThese five planes will constitute the major parts of the present course.\n\n\n@@ TODO add examples: algorithm giving outputs is a decision agent. @@ Include one with https://hjerterisiko.helsedirektoratet.no\nThere are other important aspects in engineering problems, besides the one of making decisions under uncertainty. For instance the discovery or the invention of new technologies and solutions. These aspects can barely be planned or decided; but their fruits, once available, should be handled and used optimally – thus leading to a decision problem.\nArtificial intelligence is proving to be a valuable aid in these more creative aspects too. This kind of use of AI is outside the scope of the present notes. Some aspects of this creativity-assisting use, however, do fall within the domain of the present notes. A pattern-searching algorithm, for example, can be optimized by means of the method we are going to study."

    "section": "2.3 Our goal: optimality, not “success”",
    "text": "2.3 Our goal: optimality, not “success”\nWhat should we demand from a systematic method for solving decision problems?\nBy definition, in a decision problem under uncertainty there is generally no method to determine the decision that surely leads to the desired consequence – if such a method existed, then the problem would not have any uncertainty! Therefore, if there is a method to deal with decision problems, its goal cannot be the determination of the successful decision. This also means that a priori we cannot blame an engineer for making an unsuccessful decision in a situation of uncertainty.\nImagine two persons, Henry and Tina, who must bet on “heads” or “tails” under the following conditions (but who otherwise don’t get any special thrill from betting):\n\nIf the bet is “heads” and the coin lands “heads”, the person wins a small amount of money; but if it lands “tails”, they lose a large amount of money.\nIf the bet is “tails” and the coin lands “tails”, the person wins a small amount of money; if it lands “heads”, they lose the same small amount of money.\n\nHenry chooses the first bet, on “heads”. Tina chooses the second bet, on “tails”. The coin comes down “heads”. So Henry wins the small amount of money, while Tina loses the same small amount. What would we say about their decisions?\nHenry’s decision was lucky, and yet irrational: he risked losing much more money than in the second bet, without any possibility of at least winning more. Tina’s decision was unlucky, and yet rational: the possibility and amount of winning was the same in the two bets, and she chose the bet with the least amount of loss. We expect that any person making Henry’s decision in similar, future bets will eventually lose more money than any person making Tina’s decision.\nThis example shows two points. First, “success” is generally not a good criterion to judge a decision under uncertainty; success can be the pure outcome of luck, not of smarts. Second, even if there is no method to determine which decision is successful, there is a method to determine which decision is rational or optimal, given the particular gains, losses, and uncertainties involved in the decision problem. We had a glimpse of this method in our introductory scenarios.\nLet us emphasize, however, that we are not giving up on “success”, or trading it for “optimality”. Indeed we’ll find that Decision Theory automatically leads to the successful decision in problems where uncertainty is not present or is irrelevant. It’s a win-win. It’s important to keep this point in mind:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAiming to find the solutions that are successful can make us fail to find those that are optimal when the successful ones cannot be determined.\nAiming to find the solutions that are optimal makes us automatically find those that are successful when those can be determined.\n\n\n\nWe shall later witness this fact with our own eyes, and will take it up again in the discussion of some misleading techniques to evaluate machine-learning algorithms."

    "text": "2.4 Decision Theory\nSo far we have mentioned that Decision Theory has the following features:\n\n it tells us what’s optimal and, when possible, what’s successful\n it takes into consideration decisions, consequences, costs and gains\n it is able to deal with uncertainties\n\nWhat other kinds of features should we demand from it, in order to be applied to as many kinds of decision problems as possible, and to be relevant for data science?\nIf we find an optimal decision in regards to some outcome, it may still happen that the decision can be realized in several ways that are equivalent in regard to the outcome, but inequivalent in regard to time or resources. In the assembly-line scenario, for example, the decision discard could be carried out by burning, recycling, and so on. We thus face a decision within a decision. In general, a decision problem may involve several decision sub-problems, in turn involving decision sub-sub-problems, and so on.\nIn data science, a common engineering goal is to design and build an automated or AI-based device capable of making an optimal decision in a specific kind of uncertain situations. Think for instance of an aeronautic engineer designing an autopilot system, or a software company designing an image classifier.\nDecision Theory turns out to meet these demands too, thanks to the following features:\n\n it is susceptible to recursive, sequential, and modular application\n it can be used not only for human decision-makers, but also for automated or AI devices\n\n\n\nDecision Theory has a long history, going back to Leibniz in the 1600s and partly even to Aristotle in the −300s, and appearing in its present form around 1920–1960. What’s remarkable about it is that it is not only a framework, but the framework we must use. A logico-mathematical theorem shows that any framework that does not break basic optimality and rationality criteria has to be equivalent to Decision Theory. In other words, any “alternative” framework may use different technical terminology and rewrite mathematical operations in a different way, but it boils down to the same notions and operations of Decision Theory. So if you wanted to invent and use another framework, then either (a) it would lead to some irrational or illogical consequences, or (b) it would lead to results identical to Decision Theory’s. Many frameworks that you are probably familiar with, such as optimization theory or Boolean logic, are just specific applications or particular cases of Decision Theory.\nThus we list one more important characteristic of Decision Theory:\n\n it is normative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For the extra curious\n\n\n\n\nJudgment under uncertainty\nHeuristics and Biases\nThinking, Fast and Slow\n\n\n\nNormative contrasts with descriptive. The purpose of Decision Theory is not to describe, for example, how human decision-makers typically make decisions. Because human decision-makers typically make irrational, sub-optimal, or biased decisions. That’s exactly what we want to avoid and improve!"

    "section": "3.1 Graphical representation and elements",
    "text": "3.1 Graphical representation and elements\nA basic decision problem can be represented by a diagram like this:\n\nIt has one decision node, usually represented by a square , from which the available decisions depart as lines. Each decision leads to an uncertainty node, usually represented by a circle , from which the possible outcomes depart as lines. Each outcome leads to a particular utility value. The uncertainty of each outcome is quantified by a probability.\nA basic decision problem is analysed in terms of these elements:\n\n Agent, and background or prior information. The agent is the person or device that has to make the decision. An agent always possess (or has been programmed with) specific background information that is used and taken for granted in the decision-making process. This background information determines the probabilities and utilities of the outcomes, together with other available data and information. Since different agents typically have different background information, we shall somehow conflate agents and prior information.\n\n\n\nWe’ll use the neutral pronouns it/its when referring to an agent, since an agent could be a person or a machine.\n\n Decisions, also called courses of actions, available to the agent. They are assumed to be mutually exclusive and exhaustive; this can always be achieved by recombining them if necessary, as we’ll discuss later.\n Outcomes of the possible decisions. Every decision can have a different set of outcomes, or some outcomes can appear for several or all decisions (in this case they are reported multiple times in the decision diagram). Note that even if an outcome can happen for two or more different decisions, its probabilities can still be different depending on the decision.\n Probabilities for each of the outcomes. Their values typically depend on the background information, the decision, and the additional data.\n Utilities: the gains or losses associated with each of the possible outcomes. Their values also depend on the background information, the decision, and the additional data.\n Data and other additional information, sometimes called evidence. They differ from the background information in that they can change with every decision instance made by the same agent, while the background information stays the same. In the assembly-line scenario, for example, the test results could be different for every new electric component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Remember: What matters is to be able to identify these elements in a concrete problem, understanding their role. Their technical names don’t matter.\n\n\nNote that it is not always the case that the outcomes are unknown and the data are known. As we’ll discuss later, in some situations we reason in hypothetical or counterfactual ways, using hypothetical data and considering outcomes which have already occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading\n\n\n\n§ 1.1.4 in Artificial Intelligence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the elements above in the assembly-line decision problem of the introduction 1.\nSketch the diagram of the assembly-line decision problem.\n\n\n\nSome of the decision-problem elements listed above may need to be in turn analysed by a decision sub-problem. For instance, the utilities could depend on uncertain factors: thus we have a decision sub-problem to determine the optimal values to be used for the utilities of the main problem. This is an example of the modular character of decision theory.\nWe shall soon see how to mathematically represent these elements.\nThe elements above must be identified unambiguously in every decision problem. The analysis into these elements greatly helps in making the problem and its solution well-defined.\nAn advantage of decision theory is that its application forces us to make sense of an engineering problem. A useful procedure is to formulate the general problem in terms of the elements above, identifying them clearly. If the definition of any of the terms involves uncertainty of further decisions, then we analyse it in turn as a decision sub-problem, and so on.\n\nSuppose someone (probably a politician) says: “We must solve the energy crisis by reducing energy consumption or producing more energy”. From a decision-making point of view, this person has effectively said nothing whatsoever. By definition the “energy crisis” is the problem that energy production doesn’t meet demand. So this person has only said “we would like the problem to be solved”, without specifying any solution. A decision-theory approach to this problem requires us to specify which concrete courses of action should be taken for reducing consumption or increasing productions, and what their probable outcomes, costs, and gains would be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For the extra curious\n\n\n\nSee MacKay’s options-vs-costs rational analysis in Sustainable Energy – without the hot air"

Its rules are given by the Probability Calculus. Inference is independent from decision: in some situations we may simply wish to assess whether some hypotheses, conjectures, or outcomes are more or less plausible than others, without making any decision. This kind of assessment can be very important in problems of communication and storage, and it is specially considered by Information Theory.\nThe calculation of probabilities can be the part that demands most thinking, time, and computational resources in a decision problem. It is also the part that typically makes most use of data – and where data can be most easily misused.\nRoughly half of this course will be devoted in understanding the laws of inference, their applications, uses, and misuses.\n\n Utility assesment is the stage where the gains or losses of the possible outcomes are calculated. Often this stage requires further inferences and further decision-making sub-problems. The theory underlying utility assessment is still much underdeveloped, compared to probability theory.\n\n Expected-utility maximization is the final stage where the probabilities and gains or costs of the possible outcomes are combined, in order to determine the optimal decision."

Other inferences, instead, involve an uncertainty.\nAll inferences are based on some data and information, which may be explicitly expressed or only implicitly understood.\nAn inference can be about something past, but based on present or future data and information: inferences can show all sorts of temporal relations.\nAn inference can be essentially unrepeatable, because it’s about something unrepeatable or based on unrepeatable data and information.\nThe data and information on which an inference is based can actually be unknown; that is, they can be only momentarily contemplated as real. Such an inference is said to be based on hypothetical reasoning.\nThe object of an inference can actually be something already known to be false or not real: the inference tries to assess it in the case that some data or information had been different. Such an inference is said to be based on counterfactual reasoning."

But a central point can be emphasized now:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInferences can only be drawn from other inferences.\n\n\n\nIn order to draw an inference – calculate a probability – we usually go up a chain: we must first draw other inferences, and for drawing those we must draw yet other inferences, and so on.\nAt some point we must stop at inferences that we take for granted without further proof. These typically concern direct experiences and observations. For instance, you see a tree in front of you, so you can take “there’s a tree here” as a true fact. Yet, notice that the situation is not so clear-cut: how do you know that you aren’t hallucinating, for example, and there’s actually no tree there? That is taken for granted. If you analyse the possibility of hallucination, you realize that you are taking other things for granted, and so on. Probably most philosophical research in the history of humanity has been about grappling with this runaway process – which is also a continuous source of sci-fi films. In logic and mathematical logic, this corresponds to the fact that to prove some theorem, we must always start from some axioms. There are “inferences” – tautologies – that can be drawn without requiring others; but they are all trivial, such as “this component failed early, or it didn’t”. They are of little use in a real problem, although they have a deep theoretical importance.\n\n\n\n\n\nSci-fi films like The Matrix ultimately draw on the fact that we must take some inferences for granted without further proof.\n\n\n\n\nIn concrete applications we start from many inferences upon which everyone, luckily, agrees. But sometimes we must also use starting inferences that are more dubious or not agreed upon by anyone. In this case the final inference has a somewhat contingent character, and we accept it (as well as the solution of any underlying decision problem) as the best available for the moment. This is partly the origin of the term “model”."

    "text": "5.1 The central components of knowledge representation\nWhen speaking of “data”, what comes to mind to many people is basically numbers or collections of numbers. Maybe numbers, then, could be used to represent all the variety of items exemplified above. This option, however, turns out to be too restrictive.\nI give you this number: “\\(8\\)”, saying that it is “data”. But what is it about? You, as an agent, can hardly call this number a piece of information, because you have no clue what to do with it. Instead, if I tell you: “The number of official planets in the solar system is 8”, then we can say that I’ve given you data. So “data” is not just numbers: a number is not “data” unless there’s an additional verbal, non-numeric context accompanying it, even if only implicitly. Sure, we could represent this meta-data information as numbers too; but this move would only shift the problem one level up: we would need an auxiliary verbal context explaining what the meta-data numbers are about.\nData can, moreover, be completely non-numeric. A clinician saying “The patient has fully recovered from the disease” (we imagine to know who’s the patient and what was the disease) is giving us a piece of information that we could further use, for instance, to make prognoses about other, similar patients. The clinician’s statement surely is “data”, but essentially non-numeric data. Sure, in some situations we can represent it as “1”, while “0” would represent “not recovered”; but the opposite convention could also be used, or the numbers “0.3” and “174”. These numbers have intrinsically nothing to do with the clinician’s “recovery” data.\nBut the examples above actually reveal the answer to our needs. In the examples we expressed the data by means of sentences. Clearly any measurement result, decision outcome, hypothesis, not-real event, assumption, data, and any piece of information can be expressed by a sentence.\nWe shall therefore use sentences, also called propositions or statements,1 to represent and communicate all the kinds of “items” that can be the proposal or conditional of an inference. In some cases we can of course summarize a sentence by a number, as a shorthand, when the full meaning of the sentence is understood.\n\n1 These three terms are not always equivalent in formal logic, but here we’ll use them as synonyms.\nSentences are the central components of knowledge representation in AI agents. For example they appear at the heart of automated control programs and fault-management systems in NASA spacecrafts.\n\n\n (From the SMART paper)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading\n\n\n\n\n§ 7.1 in Artificial Intelligence.\nTake a quick look at these:\n\nSMART: A propositional logic-based trade analysis and risk assessment tool for a complex mission\naround p. 22 in No More Band-Aids: Integrating FM into the Onboard Execution Architecture\n§ 2.1 in Deliberation for autonomous robots: A survey\npart IV in Model-based programming of intelligent embedded systems and robotic space explorers"

    "text": "5.2 Identifying and working with sentences\nBut what is a sentence, more exactly? The everyday meaning of this word will work for us, even though there are more precise definitions – and still a lot of research in logic an artificial intelligence on how to define and use sentences. We shall adopt this useful definition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For the extra curious\n\n\n\nPropositions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA “sentence” is a verbal message for which we can determine whether it is true or false, at least in principle and in such a way that all interested receivers of the message would agree.\n\n\nFor instance, in most engineering contexts the phrase “This valve will operate for at least two months” is a sentence; whereas the phrase “Apples are much tastier than pears” is not, because it’s a matter of personal taste – there’s no objective criterion to determine its truth or falsity (however, the phrase “Rita finds apples tastier than pears” could be a sentence; its truth is found by asking Rita). In a data-science context, the phrase “The neural-network algorithm has better performance than the random-forest one” is not a sentence unless we have objectively specified what “better” means, for example by using a particular comparison metric.\nSome expressions in fact, even involving technical terms, may appear to be sentences at first, but a deeper analysis may reveal that they are not. A famous example is the sentence “The two events (at different spatial locations) are simultaneous”. Einstein showed that there’s no physical way to determine whether such an expression is true or false. Its truth turns out to be a matter of convention (also in Newtonian mechanics). The Theory of Relativity was born from this observation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For the extra curious\n\n\n\nOn the electrodynamics of moving bodies.\n\n\nOne sentence can be expressed by many different phrases and in different languages. For instance, “The temperature is 248.15 K”, “Temperaturen ligger på minus 25 grader”, and “25 °C is the value of the temperature” all represent the same sentence.\nA sentence can contain numbers, pictures, and graphs.\nWorking with sentences, and keeping in mind that inference is about sentences, is important in several respects:\nFirst, it leads to clarity in engineering problems and makes them more goal-oriented. A data engineer must acquire information and convey information. “Acquiring information” does not simply consist in making measurements or counting something: the engineer must understand what is being measured and why. If data is gathered from third parties, the engineer must ask what exactly the data mean and how they were acquired. In designing and engineering a solution, it is important to understand what information or outcomes the end user exactly wants. The “what”, “why”, “how” are expressed by sentences. A data engineer will often ask “wait, what do you mean by that?”. This question is not just an unofficial parenthesis in the official data-transfer workflow between the engineer and someone else. It is an integral part of that workflow: it means that some information has not been completely transferred yet.\nSecond, it is extremely important in AI and machine-learning design. A (human) engineer may proceed informally when drawing inferences, without worrying about “sentences” unless a need for disambiguation arises. A data engineer who’s designing or programming an algorithm that will do inferences automatically, must instead be unambiguous and cover beforehand all possible cases that the algorithm will face.\n\n\nWe agree that the proposal and the conditional of an inference have to be sentences. This means that the proposal of the inference must be something that can only be true or false. Many inferences, especially when they concern numerical measurements, are actually collections of inferences. For example, an inference about the result of rolling a die actually consists of six separate inferences with the proposals\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\textsf{\\small`The result of the roll is 1'}\n\\\\\n&\\textsf{\\small`The result of the roll is 2'}\n\\\\\n&\\dotso\n\\\\\n&\\textsf{\\small`The result of the roll is 6'}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nLater on we shall see how to work with more complex inferences without thinking about this detail. In real applications it can be useful, on some occasions, to pause and reduce an inference to its basic set of true/false inferences; this analysis may reveal contradictions in our inference. A simple way to do this is to reduce the complex inference into a set of yes/no questions.\nThis kind of analysis is also important in information-theoretic situations: the information content provided by an inference, when measured in Shannons, is related to the minimal amount of yes/no questions that the inference answers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise\n\n\n\nRewrite each inference scenario of § 4.1 in a formal way, as one or more inferences\n\\[\n\\textit{[proposal]}\\ \\pmb{\\nonscript\\:\\Big\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{}}\\ \\textit{[conditional]}\n\\]\nwhere proposal and conditional are well-defined sentences.\nIn ambiguous cases, use your judgement and motivate your choices."

    "text": "5.3 Notation and abbreviations\nWriting full sentences would take up a lot of space. Even an expression such as “The speed is 10 m/s” is not a sentence, strictly speaking, because it leaves unspecified the speed of what, when it was measured and in which frame of reference, what we mean by “speed”, how the unit “m/s” is defined, and so on.\nTypically we leave the full content of a sentence to be understood from the context, and we denote the sentence by a simple expression such as the one above,\n\\[\n\\textsf{\\small The speed is 10\\,m/s}\n\\]\nor even more compactly introducing physical symbols:\n\\[\nv = 10\\,\\mathrm{m/s}\n\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is a physical variable denoting the speed; or even writing simply\n\\[\n10\\,\\mathrm{m/s}\n\\]\nIn some problems it’s useful to introduce symbols to denote sentences. In these notes we’ll use sans-serif italic letters: \\(\\mathsfit{A},\\mathsfit{B},\\mathsfit{a},\\mathsfit{b},\\dotsc\\),, possibly with sub- or super-scripts. For instance, the sentence “The speed is 10 m/s” could be denoted by the symbol \\(\\mathsfit{S}_{10}\\). We abbreviate such a definition like this:\n\\[\n\\mathsfit{S}_{10} \\coloneqq\\textsf{\\small`The speed is 10\\,m/s'}\n\\]\nwhich means “the symbol \\(\\mathsfit{S}_{10}\\) is defined to be the sentence \\(\\textsf{\\small`The speed is 10\\,m/s'}\\)”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n We must be wary of how much we shorten sentences\n\n\n\nConsider these three:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\textsf{\\small`The speed is measured to be 10\\,m/s'}\n\\\\\n&\\textsf{\\small`The speed is set to 10\\,m/s'}\n\\\\\n&\\textsf{\\small`The speed is reported, by a third party, to be 10\\,m/s'}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe quantity “10 m/s” is the same in all three sentences, but their meanings are very different. They represent different kinds of data. These differences greatly affect any inference about or from these data. For instance, in the third case an engineer may not take the indirectly-reported speed “10 m/s” at face value, unlike the first case. In a scenario where all three sentences can occur, it would be ambiguous to simply write “\\(v = 10\\,\\mathrm{m/s}\\)”: would the equal-sign mean “measured”, “set”, or “indirectly reported”?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise\n\n\n\nHow would you denote the three sentences above, to make their differences clear?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet familiar with abbreviations of sentences\n\n\n\nTo summarize, a sentence like\n\\[\n\\textsf{\\small`The temperature $T$ has value $x$'}\n\\]\ncould be abbreviated in these different ways:\n\nA symbol for the sentence (note the sans-serif font):\n\\[\n\\mathsfit{S}\n\\]\nSome key word appearing in the sentence:\n\\[\n\\textsf{\\small temperature}\n\\]\nAn equality:\n\\[\nT\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}x\n\\]\nThe quantity appearing in the sentence:\n\\[\nT\n\\]\nThe value appearing in the sentence:\n\\[\nx\n\\]\n\nGet familiar with these kinds of abbreviations because they’re very common.

    "text": "5.4 Connecting sentences\n\nAtomic sentences\nIn analysing the measurement results, decision outcomes, hypotheses, assumptions, data and information that enter into an inference problem, it is convenient to find a collection of basic sentences or, using a more technical term, atomic sentences out of which all other sentences of interest can be constructed. These atomic sentences often represent elementary pieces of information in the problem.\nConsider for instance the following complex sentence, which could appear in our assembly-line scenario:\n\n“The electronic component is still whole after the shock test and the subsequent heating test. The voltage reported in the final power test is either 90 mV or 110 mV.”\n\nIn this statement we can identify at least four atomic sentences, which we denote by these symbols:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathsfit{s} &\\coloneqq\\textsf{\\small`The component is whole after the shock test'}\n\\\\\n\\mathsfit{h} &\\coloneqq\\textsf{\\small`The component is whole after the heating test'}\n\\\\\n\\mathsfit{v}_{90} &\\coloneqq\\textsf{\\small`The power-test voltage reading is 90\\,mV'}\n\\\\\n\\mathsfit{v}_{110} &\\coloneqq\\textsf{\\small`The power-test voltage reading is 110\\,mV'}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe inference may actually require additional atomic sentences. For instance, it might become necessary to consider atomic sentences with other values for the reported voltage, such as\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathsfit{v}_{110} &\\coloneqq\\textsf{\\small`The power-test voltage reading is 100\\,mV'}\n\\\\\n\\mathsfit{v}_{80} &\\coloneqq\\textsf{\\small`The power-test voltage reading is 80\\,mV'}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nand so on.\n\n\nConnectives\nHow do we construct complex sentences, like the one above, out of atomic sentences?\nWe consider three ways: one operation to change a sentence into another related to it, and two operations to combine two or more sentences together. These operations are called connectives; you may have encountered them already in Boolean algebra. Our natural language offers many more operations to combine sentences, but these three connectives turn out to be all we need in virtually all engineering and data-science problems:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot:  \\(\\lnot\\)\n\nexample:\n\n\n\\[\n\\lnot \\mathsfit{s} = \\textsf{\\small`The component is broken after the shock test'}\n\\]\n\nAnd:  \\(\\land\\)\n\nexample:\n\n\n\\[\n\\mathsfit{s} \\land \\mathsfit{h} = \\textsf{\\small`The component is whole after the shock and heating tests'}\n\\]\n\nOr:  \\(\\lor\\)\n\nexample:\n\n\n\\[\n\\mathsfit{v}_{90} \\lor \\mathsfit{v}_{110} = \\textsf{\\small`The power-test voltage reading is 90\\,mV, or 110\\,mV, or both'}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThese connectives can be applied multiple times, to form increasingly complex sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Important subtleties of the connectives:\n\n\n\n\nThere is no strict correspondence between the words “not”, “and”, “or” in natural language and the three connectives. For instance the and connective could correspond to the words “but” or “whereas”, or just to a comma “ , ”.\nNot means not some kind of complementary quality, but the denial. For instance,  \\(\\lnot\\textsf{\\small`The chair is black'}\\)  generally does not mean  \\(\\textsf{\\small`The chair is white'}\\) ,   (although in some situations these two sentences could amount to the same thing).\nIt’s always best to declare explicitly what the not of a sentence concretely means. In our example we take\n\\[\n  \\lnot\\textsf{\\small`The component is whole'} \\coloneqq\\textsf{\\small`The component is broken'}\n  \\]\nBut in other examples the negation of “being whole” could comprise several different conditions. A good guideline is to always state the not of a sentence in positive terms.\nOr does not exclude that both the sentences it connects can be true. So in our example  \\(\\mathsfit{v}_{90} \\lor \\mathsfit{v}_{110}\\)  does not exclude, a priori, that the reported voltage could be both 90 mV and 110 mV. (There is a connective for that: “exclusive-or”, but it can be constructed out of the three we already have.)\n\n\n\nFrom the last remark we see that the sentence\n\\[\n\\textsf{\\small`The power-test voltage reading is 90\\,mV or 110\\,mV'}\n\\]\ndoes not correspond to   \\(\\mathsfit{v}_{90} \\lor \\mathsfit{v}_{110}\\) .  It is implicitly understood that a voltage reading cannot yield two different values at the same time. Convince yourself that the correct way to write that sentence is this:\n\\[\n(\\mathsfit{v}_{90} \\lor \\mathsfit{v}_{110})\n\\land\n\\lnot(\\mathsfit{v}_{90} \\land \\mathsfit{v}_{110})\n\\]\nFinally, the full complex sentence of the present example can be written in symbols as follows:\n\n“The electronic component is still whole after the shock test and the subsequent heating test. The voltage reported in the final power test is either 90 mV or 110 mV.”\n\n\\[\n\\textcolor[RGB]{102,204,238}{\\mathsfit{s}} \\land \\textcolor[RGB]{34,136,51}{\\mathsfit{h}} \\land\n(\\textcolor[RGB]{238,102,119}{\\mathsfit{v}_{90}} \\lor \\textcolor[RGB]{170,51,119}{\\mathsfit{v}_{110}})\n\\land\n\\lnot\n(\\textcolor[RGB]{238,102,119}{\\mathsfit{v}_{90}} \\land \\textcolor[RGB]{170,51,119}{\\mathsfit{v}_{110}})\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading\n\n\n\nJust take a quick look at § 7.4.1 in Artificial Intelligence and note the similarities with what we’ve just learned.

The two formulae with no line above are our starting inference, and a tautology.\n\n\n\n\nWe choose to compactly encode all truth-inference rules in the following way.\nFirst, represent true by the number \\(\\mathbf{1}\\), and false by \\(\\mathbf{0}\\).\nSecond, symbolically write that a proposal \\(\\mathsfit{Y}\\) is true, given a conditional \\(\\mathsfit{X}\\), as follows:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{T}(\\mathsfit{Y}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{X}) = 1\n\\]\nor “\\(=0\\)” if it’s false.\nThe rules of truth-inference are then encoded by the following equations, which must always hold for any atomic or complex sentences \\(\\mathsfit{X},\\mathsfit{Y},\\mathsfit{Z}\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule for “not”:\n\n\\[\\mathrm{T}(\\lnot \\mathsfit{X}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{Z})\n+ \\mathrm{T}(\\mathsfit{X}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{Z})\n= 1 \\tag{6.1}\\]\n\nRule for “and”:\n\n\\[\n\\mathrm{T}(\\mathsfit{X}\\land \\mathsfit{Y}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{Z})\n= \\mathrm{T}(\\mathsfit{X}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{Y}\\land \\mathsfit{Z}) \\cdot\n\\mathrm{T}(\\mathsfit{Y}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{Z})\n= \\mathrm{T}(\\mathsfit{Y}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{X}\\land \\mathsfit{Z}) \\cdot\n\\mathrm{T}(\\mathsfit{X}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{Z})\n\\tag{6.2}\\]\n\nRule for “or”:\n\n\\[\\mathrm{T}(\\mathsfit{X}\\lor \\mathsfit{Y}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{Z})\n= \\mathrm{T}(\\mathsfit{X}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{Z}) +\n\\mathrm{T}(\\mathsfit{Y}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{Z})\n- \\mathrm{T}(\\mathsfit{X}\\land \\mathsfit{Y}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{Z})\n\\tag{6.3}\\]\n\nRule of self-consistency:\n\n\\[\\mathrm{T}(\\mathsfit{X}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{X}\\land \\mathsfit{Z})\n= 1\n\\tag{6.4}\\]\n\n\n\nHow to use the rules: Each equality can be rewritten in different ways according to the usual rules of algebra.

    "text": "7.1 When truth isn’t known: probability\nWhen we cross a busy city street we look left and right to check whether any cars are approaching. We typically don’t look up to check whether something is falling from the sky. Yet, couldn’t it be false that cars are approaching at that moment? and couldn’t it be true that some object is falling from the sky? Of course both events are possible. Then why do we look left and right, but not up?\nThe main reason is that we believe strongly that cars might be approaching, and believe very weakly that some object might be falling from the sky. In other words, we consider the first occurrence to be very probable, and the second extremely improbable.\nWe shall take the notion of probability as intuitively understood (just as we did with the notion of truth). Terms equivalent for “probability” are degree of belief, plausibility, credibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Avoid likelihood as a synonym for probability\n\n\n\nIn technical discourse, “likelihood” means something different and is not a synonym of “probability”, as we’ll explain later.\n\n\nProbabilities are quantified between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), or equivalently between \\(0\\%\\) and \\(100\\%\\). Assigning to a sentence a probability 1 is the same as saying that it is true; and a probability 0, that it is false. A probability of \\(0.5\\) represents a belief completely symmetric with respect to truth and falsity.\nLet’s emphasize and agree on some important facts about probabilities:\n\n Probabilities are assigned to sentences. We already discussed this point in § 5.3, but let’s reiterate it. Consider an engineer working on a problem of electric-power distribution in a specific geographical region. At a given moment the engineer may believe with \\(75\\%\\) probability that the measured average power output in the next hour will be 100 MW. The \\(75\\%\\) probability is assigned not to the quantity “100 MW”, but to the sentence\n\\[\n\\textsf{\\small`The measured average power output in the next hour will be 100\\,MW'}\n\\]\nThis difference is extremely important. Consider the alternative sentence\n\\[\n\\textsf{\\small`The average power output in the next hour will be \\emph{set} to 100\\,MW'}\n\\]\nthe numerical quantity is the same, but the meaning is very different. The probability can therefore be very different (if the engineer is the person deciding how to set that output, the probability is \\(100\\%\\)). The probability depends not only on a number, but on what it’s being done with that number – measuring, setting, third-party reporting, and so on. Often we write simply “\\(O = \\mathrm{100\\,W}\\)” provided that the full sentence behind this kind of shorthand is understood.\n Probabilities are agent- and context-dependent. A coin is tossed, comes down heads, and is quickly hidden from view. Alice sees that it landed heads-up. Bob instead doesn’t manage to see the outcome and has no clue. Alice considers the sentence \\(\\textsf{\\small`Coin came down heads'}\\) to be true, that is, to have \\(100\\%\\) probability. Bob considers the same sentence to have \\(50\\%\\) probability.\nNote how Alice and Bob assign two different probabilities to the same sentence; yet both assignments are completely rational. If Bob assigned \\(100\\%\\) to \\(\\textsf{\\small`heads'}\\), we would suspect that he had seen the outcome after all; if he assigned \\(0\\%\\) to \\(\\textsf{\\small`heads'}\\), we would consider that groundless and silly. We would be baffled if Alice assigned \\(50\\%\\) to \\(\\textsf{\\small`heads'}\\), because she saw the outcome was actually heads; we would hypothesize that she feels unsure about what she saw.\nAn omniscient agent would know the truth or falsity of every sentence, and assign only probabilities 0 or 1. Some authors speak of “actual (but unknown) probabilities”. But if there were “actual” probabilities, they would be all 0 or 1, and it would be pointless to speak about probabilities at all – every inference would be a truth-inference.\n Probabilities are not frequencies. Consider the fraction of defective mechanical components to total components produced per year in some factory. This quantity can be physically measured and, once measured, would be agreed upon by every agent. It is a frequency, not a degree of belief or probability.\nIt is important to understand the difference between probability and frequency: mixing them up may lead to sub-optimal decisions. Later we shall say more about the difference and the precise relations between probability and frequency.\nFrequencies can be unknown to some agents. Probabilities cannot be “unknown”: they can only be difficult to calculate. Be careful when you read authors speaking of an “unknown probability”: they actually mean either “unknown frequency”, or a probability that has to be calculated (it’s “unknown” in the same sense that the value of \\(1-0.7 \\cdot 0.2/(1-0.3)\\) is “unknown” to you right now).\n Probabilities are not physical properties. Whether a tossed coin lands heads up or tails up is fully determined by the initial conditions (position, orientation, momentum, rotational momentum) of the toss and the boundary conditions (air velocity and pressure) during the flight. The same is true for all macroscopic engineering phenomena (even quantum phenomena have never been proved to be non-deterministic, and there are deterministic and experimentally consistent mathematical representations of quantum theory). So we cannot measure a probability using some physical apparatus; and the mechanisms underlying any engineering problem boil down to physical laws, not to probabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reading\n\n\n\nDynamical Bias in the Coin Toss. \n\n\n\n\nThese points listed above are not just a matter of principle. They have important practical consequences. A data scientist who is not attentive to the source of the data (measured? set? reported, and so maybe less trustworthy?), or who does not carefully assess the context of a probability, or who mixes a probability with a frequency, or who does not take advantage (when possible) of the physics involved in the a problem – such data scientist will design systems with sub-optimal performance1 – or even cause deaths.1 This fact can be mathematically proven."

We know that the component failed early, but we don’t know whether it passed the shock test. Hence the conditional is \\(\\mathsfit{f}\\land \\mathsfit{J}\\).\nThe target inference is therefore\n\\[\n\\color[RGB]{238,102,119}\\mathrm{P}(\\lnot\\mathsfit{h}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{f}\\land \\mathsfit{J})\n\\]\n\n\nStarting inferences\nWe are told that if an electric component fails early, then at production it didn’t pass either the heating test or the shock test. Let’s write this as\n\\[\n\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}\\mathrm{P}(\\lnot\\mathsfit{h}\\lor \\lnot\\mathsfit{s}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{f}\\land \\mathsfit{J}) = 1\n\\]\nWe are also told that there is a \\(10\\%\\) probability that both tests fail\n\\[\n\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}\\mathrm{P}(\\lnot\\mathsfit{h}\\land \\lnot\\mathsfit{s}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{f}\\land \\mathsfit{J}) = 0.1\n\\]\nFinally the problem says that there’s no reason to believe that the component didn’t pass the heating test, more than it didn’t pass the shock test. This can be written as follows:\n\\[\n\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}\\mathrm{P}(\\lnot\\mathsfit{h}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{f}\\land \\mathsfit{J}) = \\mathrm{P}(\\lnot\\mathsfit{s}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{f}\\land \\mathsfit{J})\n\\]\nNote this interesting situation: we are not given the numerical values of these two probabilities, we are only told that they are equal. This is an example of application of the principle of indifference, which we’ll discuss more in detail later.\n\n\nFinal inference\nAlso in this case there is no unique way of applying the rules to reach our target inference, but all ways lead to the same result. Let’s try to proceed backwards:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\color[RGB]{238,102,119}\\mathrm{P}(\\lnot\\mathsfit{h}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{f}\\land \\mathsfit{J})&&\n\\\\[1ex]\n&\\qquad= {\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}\\mathrm{P}(\\lnot\\mathsfit{s}\\lor \\lnot\\mathsfit{h}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{f}\\land \\mathsfit{J})}\n+ {\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}\\mathrm{P}(\\lnot\\mathsfit{s}\\land \\lnot\\mathsfit{h}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{f}\\land \\mathsfit{J})}\n- \\mathrm{P}(\\lnot\\mathsfit{s}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{f}\\land \\mathsfit{J})\n&&\\text{\\small ∨-rule}\n\\\\[1ex]\n&\\qquad= {\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}1}\n+ {\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}0.1}\n- \\mathrm{P}(\\lnot\\mathsfit{s}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{f}\\land \\mathsfit{J})\n&&\\text{\\small starting inferences}\n\\\\[1ex]\n&\\qquad= 0.1 + \\color[RGB]{34,136,51}\\mathrm{P}(\\mathsfit{s}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{f}\\land \\mathsfit{J})\n&&\\text{\\small ¬-rule}\n\\\\[1ex]\n&\\qquad= 0.1 + \\mathrm{P}(\\mathsfit{h}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{f}\\land \\mathsfit{J})\n&&\\text{\\small starting inference}\n\\\\[1ex]\n&\\qquad= 0.1 + 1 -\\color[RGB]{238,102,119}\\mathrm{P}(\\lnot\\mathsfit{h}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{f}\\land \\mathsfit{J})\n&&\\text{\\small ¬-rule}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThe target probability appears on the left and right side with opposite signs.

Bayes’s theorem allows you to find your degree of belief about \\(\\mathsfit{Y}\\) conditional on your new state of knowledge, from the one conditional on your old state of knowledge.\nThis chronological element, however, comes only from this particular way of using Bayes’s theorem.

    "text": "7.10 Remarks on terminology and notation\n\nLikelihood\nIn everyday language, “likely” is often a synonym of “probable”, and “likelihood” of “probability”. But in technical questions about probability, inference, and decision-making, “likelihood” has a very different meaning. Keep in mind this important difference of definition:\n\\(\\mathrm{P}(\\mathsfit{Y}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{}\\mathsfit{X})\\) is:\n\nthe probability of \\(\\mathsfit{Y}\\) given \\(\\mathsfit{X}\\) (or conditional on \\(\\mathsfit{X}\\)),\nthe likelihood of \\(\\mathsfit{X}\\) in view of \\(\\mathsfit{Y}\\).\n\nLet’s express this also in a different way:\n\n\\(\\mathrm{P}({\\color[RGB]{68,119,170}\\mathsfit{Y}}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{}\\mathsfit{X})\\) is the probability of \\(\\mathsfit{Y}\\) given \\(\\mathsfit{X}\\),\n\\(\\mathrm{P}(\\mathsfit{X}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{}{\\color[RGB]{68,119,170}\\mathsfit{Y}})\\) is the likelihood of \\(\\mathsfit{Y}\\) in view of \\(\\mathsfit{X}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA priori there is no relation between the probability and the likelihood of a sentence \\(\\mathsfit{Y}\\): this sentence could have very high probability and very low likelihood, and vice versa.\n\n\nIn these notes we’ll avoid the possibly confusing term “likelihood”. All we need to express can be phrased in terms of “probability”.\n\n\nOmitting background information\nIn the analyses of the inference examples of § 6.1 and § 7.2 we defined sentences (\\(\\mathsfit{I}\\) and \\(\\mathsfit{J}\\)) expressing all background information, and always included these sentences in the conditionals of the inferences – because those inferences obviously depended on that background information.\nIn many concrete inference problems the background information usually stays there in the conditional from beginning to end, while the other sentences jump around between conditional and proposal as we apply the rules of inference. For this reason the background information is often omitted from the notation, being implicitly understood. For instance, if the background information is denoted \\(\\mathsfit{I}\\), one writes\n\n“\\(\\mathrm{P}(\\mathsfit{Y}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{}\\mathsfit{X})\\)”  instead of  \\(\\mathrm{P}(\\mathsfit{Y}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{}\\mathsfit{X}\\land \\mathsfit{I})\\)\n“\\(\\mathrm{P}(\\mathsfit{Y})\\)”  instead of  \\(\\mathrm{P}(\\mathsfit{Y}\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{}\\mathsfit{I})\\)\n\nThis is what’s happening when you see in books probabilities “\\(P(x)\\)” without conditional.\nSuch practice may be convenient, but be wary of it, especially in particular situations:\n\nIn some inference problems we suddenly realize that we must distinguish between cases that depend on hypotheses, say \\(\\mathsfit{H}_1\\) and \\(\\mathsfit{H}_2\\), that were buried in the background information \\(\\mathsfit{I}\\). If the background information \\(\\mathsfit{I}\\) is explicitly reported in the notation, this is no problem: we can rewrite it as\n\\[ \\mathsfit{I}= (\\mathsfit{H}_1 \\lor \\mathsfit{H}_2) \\land \\mathsfit{I}'\\]\nand proceed, for example using the rule of extension of the conversation. If the background information was not explicitly written, this may lead to confusion and mistakes. For instance there may suddenly appear two instances of \\(\\mathrm{P}(\\mathsfit{X})\\) with different values, just because one of them is invisibly conditional on \\(\\mathsfit{I}\\), the other on \\(\\mathsfit{I}'\\).\nIn some inference problems we are considering several different instances of background information – for example because more than one agent is involved. It’s then extremely important to write the background information explicitly, lest we mix up the different agents’s degrees of belief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For the extra curious\n\n\n\nA once-famous paper published the quantum-theory literature, arrived at completely wrong results simply by omitting background information, mixing up probabilities having different conditionals.\n\n\nThis kind of confusion from poor notation happens more often than one thinks, and even appears in scientific literature.\n\n\n“Random variables”\nSome texts speak of the probability of a “random variable”, or more precisely of the probability “that a random variable takes on a particular value”. As you notice, we have just expressed that idea by means of a sentence. The viewpoint and terminology of random variables is therefore a special case of that based on sentences, which we use here.\nThe dialect of “random variables” does not offer any advantages in concepts, notation, terminology, or calculations, but it has some shortcomings:\n\nAs discussed in § 7.1, in concrete applications it is important to know how a quantity “takes on” a value: for example it could be directly measured, indirectly reported, or purposely set to that specific value. Thinking and working in terms of sentences, rather than of random variables, allows us to account for these important differences.\nVery often the object (proposal) of a probability is not a “variable”: it is actually a constant value that is simply unknown.\nWhat does “random” (or “chance”) mean? Good luck finding an understandable and non-circular definition in texts that use that word; strangely enough, they never define it. In these notes, if the word “random” is ever used, it stands for “unpredictable” or “unsystematic”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell is one of the main founders of statistical mechanics and kinetic theory (and electromagnetism). Yet he never used the word “random” in his technical writings. Maxwell is known for being very clear and meticulous with explanations and terminology.\n\n\nIt’s a question for sociology of science why some people keep on using less flexible points of view or terminologies. Probably they just memorize them as students and then a fossilization process sets in.\n\n\nFinally, some texts speak of the probability of an “event”. For all purposes an “event” is just what’s expressed in a sentence."

    "text": "8.1 Quantities\n\nQuantities, values, domains\nMost decisions and inferences in engineering and data science involve things or properties of real things. We represent them by mathematical objects – most often, collections of numbers – with particular mathematical properties and operations. The mathematical properties reflect the kind of activities that we can do with these things. For instance, colours are represented by particular tuples of numbers, and these tuples can be multiplied by some numeric weights and added, to obtain another tuple. This mathematical operation represents the fact that colours can be obtained by mixing other colours in different proportions. Physics and engineering are founded on this approach.\nIt’s difficult to find a general term to denote any instance of such “things” and their mathematical representation, but it’s convenient to find one for presenting the general theory without getting bogged down in individual cases. We’ll borrow the term quantity from physics and engineering.\nWe distinguish between a quantity and its value. For instance, a quantity could be “The temperature at the point with coordinates  60.3775029, 5.3869233, 643,  at time 1895-10-04T10:03:14Z”; and its value could be \\(24\\,\\mathrm{°C}\\).\nThis distinction is necessary in inference and decision problems, because we may not know the value of a particular quantity. We then consider every possible value that quantity could have, and we can assign a probability to each. The set of possible values is called the domain of the quantity. In our temperature example, the domain is the set of all possible temperatures from \\(0\\,\\mathrm{K}\\) and above.\nAnother example:\n\nquantity: the image taken by a particular camera at a particular time, represented by a specific collection of numbers (say 128 × 128 × 3$ integers between \\(0\\) and \\(255\\))\nvalues: one possible value is this:  (corresponding to a grid of 128 × 128 × 3 specific numbers), another possible value is this: , and there are many other possible values\ndomain: the collection of \\(256^{3\\times128\\times128} \\approx 10^{118 370}\\) possible images (corresponding to the collection of possible grids of numeric values)\n\nOther examples of quantities and domains:\n\nThe distance between two objects in the Solar System at a specific time. The domain could be, say, all values from \\(0\\,\\mathrm{m}\\) to \\(6\\cdot10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\) (Pluto’s average orbital distance).\nThe number of total views of some online video (at a specific time), with a domain, say, from 0 to 20 billions.\nThe force on an object (at a specific time and place). The domain could be, say, 3D vectors with components in \\([-100\\,\\mathrm{N},\\,+100\\,\\mathrm{N}]\\).\nThe degree of satisfaction in a customer survey, with five possible values Not at all satisfied, Slightly satisfied, Moderately satisfied, Very satisfied, Extremely satisfied.\nThe graph representing a particular social network. Individuals are represented by nodes, and different kinds of relationships by directed or undirected links between nodes, possibly with numbers indicating their strength. The domain consists of all possible graphs with, say, \\(0\\) to \\(10000\\) nodes and all possible combinations of links and weights between the nodes.\nThe relationship between the input voltage and output current of an electric component. The domain could be all possible continuous curves from \\([0\\,\\mathrm{V}, 10\\,\\mathrm{V}]\\) to \\([0\\,\\mathrm{A}, 1\\,\\mathrm{A}]\\).\nA 1-minute audio track recorded by a device with a sampling frequency of 48 kHz. The domain could be all possible 2 880 000 values in \\([0,1]\\).\nThe subject of an image, with domain of three possible values cat, dog, something else.\nThe roll, pitch, yaw of a rocket (at a specific time and place), with domain \\((-180°,+180°]\\times(-90°,+90°]\\times(-180°,+180°]\\).\n\n\n\nThe vague term “data” typically means the values of a collection of quantities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Quantity vs variate\n\n\n\nIn these notes, we agree that a quantity has one, and only one, value.\nWe can consider something that changes with time, or with space, or from individual to individual, or from unit to unit. This “something” is then a collection of quantities: one for each time, or space, or individual. We call this collection a variate, especially when it refers to individuals or unit; or a variable.\nThese are just terminological conventions adopted in these notes. Different texts often adopt different terms. What matters is not the terms, but that you have a clear understanding of the difference between the two notions that here we call “quantity” and “variate”.\n\n\n\n\nNotation\nWe shall denote quantities by italic letters, such as \\(X\\) for example. The sentences that appear in decision-making and inferences are therefore often of the kind “the quantity \\(X\\) was observed to have value \\(x\\)”, where “\\(x\\)” stands for a specific value, for instance . This kind of sentences are often abbreviated like “\\(X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}x\\)”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n but keep in mind our discussion from § 5.3: we must make clear what that “\\(=\\)” means; it could mean “observed”, “set”, “reported”, and so on."

    "section": "8.2 Basic types of quantities",
    "text": "8.2 Basic types of quantities\nAs the examples above show, quantities and data come in all sorts and with different degrees of complexity. There is no clear-cut divide between different sorts of quantities. The same quantity can moreover be viewed and represented in many different ways, depending on the specific context, problem, purpose, and background information.\nIt is possible, however, to roughly differentiate between a handful of basic types of quantities, from which more complex types are built. Here is one kind of differentiation that is useful for inference problems about quantities:\n\nNominal\nA nominal or categorical quantity has a domain with a discrete and usually finite number of values. The values are not related by any mathematical property, and do not have any specific order.\nThis means that it does not make sense to say, for instance, that some value is “twice” or “1.5 times” another, or “larger” or “later” than another one. Nor does it make sense to “add” two quantities. In particular, there is no notion of average for a nominal quantity.\nExamples: the possible breeds of a dog, or the characters of a film.\nIt is of course possible to represent the values of a nominal quantity with numbers; say 1 for Dachshund, 2 for Labrador, 3 for Dalmatian, and so on. But that doesn’t mean that\nDalmatian\\({}-{}\\)Labrador\\({}={}\\)Labrador\\({}-{}\\)Dachshund\nor similar nonsense.\n\n\nOrdinal\nAn ordinal quantity has a domain with a discrete and usually finite number of values. The values are not related by any mathematical property, but they do have a specific order.\nThis means that it does not make sense to say that some value is “twice” or “1.5 times” another, and we cannot “add” two values. But it does make sense to say, for any two values, which one has higher rank, for example “stronger”, or “later”, “larger”, and similar. Also in this case there is no notion of average for an ordinal quantity.\nExample: a pain-intensity scale. A patient can say whether some pain is more severe than another, but it isn’t clear what pain “twice as severe” as another would mean (although there’s a lot of research on more precise quantification of pain). Another example: the “strength of friendship” in a social network. We can say that we have a “stronger friendship” with a person than with another; but it doesn’t make sense to say that we are “four times stronger friends” with a person than with another.\nIt is possible to represent the values of an ordinal quantity with numbers which reflect the order of the values. But it’s important to keep in mind that differences or averages of such numbers does not make sense. For this reason the use of numbers can be deceptive at times. A less deceptive possibility is to represent ordered values by alphabet letters, for example.\n\n\nBinary\nA binary or dichotomous quantity has only two possible values. It can be seen as a special case of a nominal or ordinal quantity, but the fact of having only two values lends it some special properties in inference problems. This is why we list it separately.\nObviously it doesn’t make much sense to speak of the difference or average of the two values; and their ranking is trivial even if it makes sense.\nThere’s an abundance of examples of binary quantities: yes/no answers, presence/absence of something, and so on.\n\n\nInterval\nAn interval quantity has a domain that can be discrete or continuous, finite or infinite. The values do admit some mathematical operations, at least convex combination and subtraction. They also admit an ordering.\nThis means that we can say, at the very least, whether the interval or “distance” between a pair of values is the same, or larger, or smaller than the interval between another pair. For this reason we can also say whether a value is larger than another. We can also take weighted sums of values, called convex combinations (but simple addition of values may still be meaningless, though).\nOwing to these mathematical properties, it does make sense to speak of the average for an interval quantity.\nThe number of electronic components produced in a year by an assembly line is an example of a discrete interval quantity. The power output of a nuclear plant at a given time is an example of a continuous one.\nIt is also possible to speak of ratio quantities, which are a special case of interval quantities, but we won’t have use of this distinction in the present notes.\n\n\nHow to decide the basic type of a quantity?\nTo attribute a basic type to a quantity we must ultimately check how that quantity is defined, obtained, and used. In some cases the values of the quantity may give some clue; for example, if we see values “\\(2.74\\)”, “\\(8.23\\)”, “\\(3.01\\)”, then the quantity is probably of the interval kind. But if we see values “\\(1\\)”, “\\(2\\)”, “\\(3\\)”, it’s unclear whether the quantity is interval, ordinal, nominal, or maybe of yet some other kind.\nThe type of a quantity also depends on its use in the specific problem. A quantity of a more complex type can be treated as a simpler type if needed. For instance, the response time of some device is in principle an interval quantity; but in a specific situation we could simply label its values as slow, medium, fast, thus making it an ordinal quantity.\n@@ TODO: add examples for image spaces\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercises\n\n\n\n\nFor each example at the beginning of the present section, assess whether that quantity can be considered as being of a basic type, and which type.\nFor each basic type discussed above, find two more concrete examples of that type of quantity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For the extra curious\n\n\n\nOn the theory of scales of measurement"

    "text": "8.3 Other attributes of basic types\nIt is useful to consider other basic aspects of quantities that are somewhat transversal to “type”. These aspects are also important when drawing inferences.\n\nDiscrete vs continuous\nNominal and ordinal quantities have discrete domains. The domain of an interval quantity can be discrete or continuous. In practice all domains are discrete, since we cannot observe, measure, report, or store values with infinite precision. In a modern computer, for example, a real number can “only” take on \\(2^{64} \\approx 20 000 000 000 000 000 000\\) possible values. In many situations the available precision is so high that we can consider the quantity as continuous for all practical purposes and use the mathematics of continuous sets – derivation, integration, and so on – to our advantage.\n@@ TODO comment on repetition\n\n\nBounded vs unbounded\nOrdinal and interval quantities may have domains with no minimum value, or no maximum value, or neither. Typical terms for these situations are lower- or upper-bounded, or left- or right-bounded, and unbounded; or similar terms.\nWhether to treat a quantity domain as bounded or unbounded depends on the quantity, the specific problem, and the computational resources. For example, the number of times a link on a webpage has been clicked can in principle be (right-)unbounded. Another example is the distance between two objects: we can consider it unbounded, but in concrete problems might be bounded, say, by the size of a laboratory, or by Earth’s circumference, or the Solar System’s extension, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercises\n\n\n\n\nIf you had to set a maximum number of times a web link can be clicked, what number would you choose? Try to find a reasonable number, considering factors such as how fast a person can repeatedly click on a link, how long can a website (or the Earth?) last, and how many people can live in such an extent of time.\nWhat about the age of a person? What bound would you set, if you had to treat it as a bounded quantity?\n\n\n\n\n\nFinite vs infinite\nThe domain of a discrete quantity can consist of a finite or – at least in theory – an infinite number of possible values (the domain of a continuous quantity always has an infinite number of values). A domain can be infinite and yet bounded: consider the numbers in the range \\([0,1]\\).\nWhether to treat a domain as finite or infinite depends on the quantity, the specific problem, and the computational resources. For example, the intensity of a base colour in a pixel of a particular image might really take on 256 discrete steps between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\): \\(0, 0.0039215686, 0.0078431373, \\dotsc, 1\\). But in some situations we can treat this domain as practically infinite, with any possible value between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\n\n\nRounded\nA continuous interval quantity may be rounded, owing to the way it’s measured. In this case the quantity could be considered discrete rather than continuous. Rounding can impact the way we do inferences about such a quantity.\n\n\n The Iris dataset from its original paper\nThe famous Iris dataset, for instance, consists of several lengths – continuous interval quantities – of parts of flowers. All values are rounded to the millimetre, even if in reality the lengths could have intermediate values, of course. The age of a person is another frequent example of an in-principle continuous quantity which is rounded, say to the year or the month.\nIn some situations it’s important to be aware of rounding, because it can lead to quantities with different unrounded values to have identical rounded ones.\n\n\nCensored\nThe measurement procedure of a quantity may have an artificial lower or upper bound. A clinical thermometer, for instance, could have a maximum reading of \\(45\\,\\mathrm{°C}\\). If we measure with it the temperature of a \\(50\\,\\mathrm{°C}\\)-hot body, we’ll read “\\(45\\,\\mathrm{°C}\\)”, not the real temperature.\nA quantity with this characteristic is called censored, more specifically left-censored or right-censored when there’s only one artificial bound. The bound is called the censoring value.\nA censoring value denotes an actual value that could also be greater or less. This is important when we draw inferences about this kind of quantities."

We shall call these joint quantities when we need to distinguish them from quantities of a basic kind; but usually they are also simply called quantities.\nThe values of a joint quantity are just tuples of values of its basic component quantities.

    "text": "9.2 Complex quantities\nSome complex quantities can be represented as sets of quantities of basic types. These sets, however, are “more than the sum of their parts”: they possess new physical and mathematical properties and operations that do not apply or do not make sense for the single components.\nFamiliar examples are vectorial quantities from physics and engineering, such as location, velocity, force, torque. Another example are images, when represented as grids of basic quantities.\nConsider for example a 4 × 4 monochrome image, represented as a grid of 16 binary quantities \\(0\\) or \\(1\\). Three possible values could be these:\n    \nrepresented by the numeric matrices   \\(\\begin{psmallmatrix}1&0&0&0\\\\0&0&0&0\\\\0&0&0&0\\\\0&0&0&0\\end{psmallmatrix}\\), \\(\\begin{psmallmatrix}0&1&0&0\\\\0&0&0&0\\\\0&0&0&0\\\\0&0&0&0\\end{psmallmatrix}\\), \\(\\begin{psmallmatrix}0&0&0&0\\\\0&0&0&0\\\\0&0&0&0\\\\0&0&0&1\\end{psmallmatrix}\\).\nFrom the point of view of the individual binary quantities, these three “values” are equally different from one another: where one of them has grid value \\(1\\), the others have \\(0\\). But properly considered as images, we can say that the first and the second are somewhat more “similar” or “closer” to each other than the first and the third. This similarity can be represented and quantified by a metric over the domain of all such images. This metric involves all basic binary quantities at once; it is not a property of each of them individually.\nMore generally, complex quantities have additional, peculiar properties, represented by mathematical structures, which distinguish them from simpler joint quantities; although there is not a clear separation between the two.\nThese properties and structures are very important for inference problems, and usually make them computationally very hard. The importance of machine-learning methods lies to a great extent in the fact that they allow us to do approximate inference on these kinds of complex data. The peculiar structures of these data, however, are often also the cause of striking failures of some machine-learning methods, for example the reason why they may classify incorrectly, or correctly but for the wrong reasons."

For an ordinal or interval quantity, the sequence of values on the line should correspond to their natural order. For a nominal quantity the order is irrelevant.\nA rectangle is then drawn above each value. Typically the rectangles are contiguous. The bases of the rectangles are all equal, and the areas of the rectangles are proportional to the probabilities. Since the bases are equal, this implies that the heights of the rectangles are also proportional to the probabilities.\nSuch kind of drawing can of course be horizontal, vertical, upside-down, and so on, depending on convenience.\nSince the probabilities must sum to one, the total area of the rectangles represents the unit of area. So in principle there is no need of writing probability values on some vertical axis, or grid, or similar visual device, because the probability value can be visually read as the ratio of a rectangle area to the total area. An axis or grid can nevertheless be helpful. Alternatively the probabilities can be reported above or below each rectangle.\nNominal quantities do not have any specific order, so their values do not need to be ordered on a line. Other area-based representations, such as pie charts, can also be used for these quantities.\n\n\nLine-based representations\nHistograms give faithful representations of discrete probability distributions. Their graphical bulkiness, however, can be a disadvantage in some situations; for instance when we want to have a clearer idea of how the probability distribution varies across values (for ordinal or interval quantities); or when we want to compare several probability distributions over the same values.\n\n\n Representation of the same pair of probability distributions with a histogram plot and a line plot \nIn these cases we can use standard line plots, or variations thereof. Compare the examples on the margin figure: the line plot displays more cleanly the differences between the “before-inspection” and “after-inspection” probability distributions."

Here we follow a practical and realistic approach for working with such distributions.\nConsider a quantity \\(X\\) with a continuous domain. When we say that such a quantity has some value \\(x\\) we really mean that it has a value somewhere in the range   \\(x -\\epsilon/2\\)  to  \\(x+\\epsilon/2\\),   where the width \\(\\epsilon\\) is usually extremely small. For example, for double-precision values stored in a computer, the width must be at least \\(\\epsilon \\approx 2\\cdot 10^{-16}\\) :\n## R code\n&gt; 1.234567890123456 == 1.234567890123455\n[1] FALSE\n\n&gt; 1.2345678901234567 == 1.2345678901234566\n[1] TRUE\nand a value 1.3 really represents a range between 1.29999999999999982236431605997495353221893310546875 and 1.300000000000000266453525910037569701671600341796875, this range coming from the internal binary representation of 1.3. Often the width \\(\\epsilon\\) is much larger than the computer’s precision, and comes from the precision with which the value is experimentally measured.\nProbabilities are therefore assigned to such small ranges, not to single values. Since these ranges are very small, they are also very numerous. The total probability assigned to all of them must still amount to \\(1\\); therefore each small range receives an extremely small amount of probability. A standard Gaussian distribution for a real quantity, for instance, assigns a probability of approximately \\(8\\cdot 10^{-17}\\), or \\(0.00000000000000008\\), to a range of width \\(2\\cdot 10^{-16}\\) around the value \\(0\\). All other ranges are assigned even smaller probabilities.\nIn would be impractical to work with such small probabilities. We use probability densities instead. As implied by the term “density”, a probability density is the amount of probability \\(P\\) assigned to a standard range of width \\(\\epsilon\\), divided by that width. For example, if the probability assigned to a range of width  \\(\\epsilon=2\\cdot10^{-16}\\)  around \\(0\\) is  \\(P=7.97885\\cdot10^{-17}\\),  then the probability density around \\(0\\) is\n\\[\n\\frac{P}{\\epsilon} =\n\\frac{7.97885\\cdot10^{-17}}{2\\cdot10^{-16}} = 0.398942\n\\]\nwhich is a simpler number to work with.\nProbability densities are convenient because they usually do not depend on the range width \\(\\epsilon\\), if it’s small enough. Owing to physics reasons, we don’t expect a situation where \\(X\\) is between \\(0.9999999999999999\\) and \\(1.0000000000000001\\) to be very different from one where \\(X\\) is between \\(1.0000000000000001\\) and \\(1.0000000000000003\\). The probabilities assigned to these two small ranges of width \\(\\epsilon=2\\cdot 10^{-16}\\) each will therefore be approximately equal, let’s say \\(P\\) each. Now if we use a small range of width \\(\\epsilon\\) around \\(X=1\\), the probability is \\(P\\), and the probability density is \\(P/\\epsilon\\). If we consider a range of double width \\(2\\,\\epsilon\\) around \\(X=1\\), then the probability is \\(P+P\\) instead, but the probability density is still\n\\[\\frac{P+P}{2\\,\\epsilon} =\n\\frac{1.59577\\cdot10^{-16}}{4\\cdot10^{-16}}\n= 0.398942 \\ .\n\\]\nAs you see, even if we consider a range with double the width as before, the probability density is still the same.\n\n\nIn these notes we’ll denote probability densities with a lowercase \\(\\mathrm{p}\\), with the following notation:\n\\[\n\\underbracket[0pt]{\\mathrm{p}}_{\\mathrlap{\\color[RGB]{119,119,119}\\!\\uparrow\\ \\textit{lowercase}}}(X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}x \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{I}) \\coloneqq\n\\frac{\n\\overbracket[0pt]{\\mathrm{P}}^{\\mathrlap{\\color[RGB]{119,119,119}\\!\\downarrow\\ \\textit{uppercase}}}(\\textsf{\\small`\\(X\\) has value between \\(x-\\epsilon/2\\) and \\(x+\\epsilon/2\\)'} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{I})\n}{\\epsilon}\n\\]\nThis definition works even if we don’t specify the exact value of \\(\\epsilon\\), as long as it’s small enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Probability densities are not probabilities\n\n\n\nIf \\(X\\) is a continuous quantity, the expression “\\(\\mathrm{p}(X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}2.5 \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{I})=0.3\\)” does not mean “There is a \\(0.3\\) probability that \\(X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}2.5\\)”. The probability that \\(X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}2.5\\) exactly is, if anything, zero.\nThat expression means “There is a  \\(0.3\\cdot \\epsilon\\)   probability that \\(X\\) is between \\(2.5-\\epsilon/2\\) and \\(2.5+\\epsilon/2\\), for any \\(\\epsilon\\) small enough”.\nIn fact, probability densities can be larger than 1, because they are obtained by dividing by a number, the range width, that is in principle arbitrary. This fact shows that they cannot be probabilities.\nIt is important not to mix up probability and probability densities: we shall see later that densities have very different properties, for example with respect to maxima and averages.\n\n\nA helpful practice (though followed by few texts) is to always write a probability density as\n\\[\\mathrm{p}(X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}x \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{I})\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\]\nwhere “\\(\\mathrm{d}x\\)” stands for the width of a small range around \\(x\\). This notation is also helpful with integrals. Unfortunately it becomes a little cumbersome when we are dealing with more than one quantity."

The difference from histograms for discrete quantities lies in the values reported on the vertical axis: for discrete quantities the values are probabilities (the areas of the rectangles), but for continuous quantities they are probability densities (the heights of the rectangles). This is also evident from the fact that the values reported on the vertical axis can be larger than 1, as in the plots on the side.\nThe rectangles, however, are so thin (usually thinner than a pixel on a screen) that they appear just as vertical lines, and together they look just like a curve delimiting a coloured area. If we don’t colour the area underneath we just have a line-based representation of the probability density.\n\n\n   As the width \\(\\epsilon\\) of the small ranges is decreased, a histogram based on these widths become indistinguishable from a line plot\n\n\nScatter plots\nLine plots of a probability density are very informative, but they can also be slightly deceiving. Try the following experiment.\nConsider a continuous quantity \\(X\\) with the following probability density:\n\nWe want to represent the amount of probability in any small range, say between \\(X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}0\\) and \\(X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}0.1,\\) by drawing in that range a number of short thin lines, the number being proportional to the probability. So a range with 10 lines has twice the probability of a range with 5 lines. The probability density around a value is therefore roughly represented by the density of the lines around that value.\nSuppose that we have 50 lines available to distribute this way. Where should we place them?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise\n\n\n\n\nWhich of these plots shows the correct placement of the 50 lines?

Scatter plots often give a less misleading representation of the probability density.\nScatter plots are also useful for representing probability densities in more than one dimension – sometimes even in infinite dimensions!

Let’s explain this procedure with an example.\nBack to our initial assembly-line scenario from § 1, the inference problem was to predict whether a specific component would fail within a year or not.

    "text": "11.3 Representation of joint probability distributions\nThere is a wide variety of ways of representing joint probability distributions, and new ways are invented (and rediscovered) all the time. In some cases, especially when the quantity has more than three component quantities, it can become impossible to graphically represent the probability distribution in a faithful way. Therefore one often tries to represent only some aspects or features of interest from the full distribution. Whenever you see a plot of a joint probability distribution, you should carefully read what the plot shows and how it was made. Here we only illustrate some examples and ideas for representations.\n\nTables\nWhen a quantity is bivariate and its two component quantities are both discrete and finite, the joint probabilities can be reported as a table.\nExample: Consider the next patient that will arrive at a particular hospital. There’s the possibility of arrival by ambulance, helicopter, or other transportation means; and the possibility that the patient will need urgent non-urgent care. These can be seen as two quantities \\(A\\) (nominal) and \\(U\\) (binary).

The joint probability density can be visualized as in the plot in the margin. From the plot we can see that the probability of urgent patients is generally lower than non-urgent ones.

    "text": "12.2 Conditional probability distributions\nA joint probability distribution quantifies an agent’s uncertainty about all the quantities that compose a joint quantity. This means that in general the agent has no sure certainty about any of them (there are of course special cases where probabilities can be \\(0\\) or \\(1\\), but they are not the general case). Suppose that the agent has a joint probability for the quantities \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), conditional on a state of knowledge \\(\\mathsfit{I}\\):\n\\[ \\mathrm{P}({\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}x},{\\color[RGB]{238,102,119}Y\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}y} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{}\\mathsfit{I}) \\]\nNow consider these two situations:\n\nthe agent acquires knowledge that \\(X\\) has true value \\(x\\), so its state of knowledge has changed;\nfor inference purposes, the agents needs to hypothetically assume that the quantity \\(X\\) has value \\(x\\) (even if that might not be the case in reality);\n\nand, in either situation, the agent needs the probability that \\(Y\\) has value \\(y\\).

It is somewhat a misnomer, because all probabilities are conditional on something. The implicit understanding here is that new information has been added to the conditional with respect to some base state of knowledge.\nWhat is the numerical value of the conditional probability above? We simply use the and-rule:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{P}({\\color[RGB]{238,102,119}Y\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}y} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} {\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}x}, \\mathsfit{I}) =\n\\frac{\\mathrm{P}({\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}x},{\\color[RGB]{238,102,119}Y\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}y} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{}\\mathsfit{I})}{\\mathrm{P}({\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}x} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{I})}\n\\]\nThe denominator is the marginal probability for \\(X\\), which can also be calculated from the joint distribution as discussed in § 12.1:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{P}({\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}x} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathsfit{I}) = \\sum_{\\color[RGB]{238,102,119}y} \\mathrm{P}({\\color[RGB]{238,102,119}Y\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}y}, {\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}x} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{}\\mathsfit{I})\n\\]\nWe can thus rewrite the conditional probability as\n\\[\n\\mathrm{P}({\\color[RGB]{238,102,119}Y\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}y} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} {\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}x}, \\mathsfit{I}) =\n\\frac{\\mathrm{P}({\\color[RGB]{238,102,119}Y\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}y}, {\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}x} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{}\\mathsfit{I})}{\\sum_{\\color[RGB]{238,102,119}y} \\mathrm{P}({\\color[RGB]{238,102,119}Y\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}y}, {\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}X\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}x} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{}\\mathsfit{I})}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise\n\n\n\nConsider the next-patient problem with the joint probability of table 11.1:\n\nCalculate the probability that the next patient needs urgent care, knowing that the patient will arrive by helicopter.\nCompare the conditional probability you just found with the marginal probability that the next patient needs urgent care, independently of transportation means (calculated in a previous exercise).

Consider the following examples:\n\n\nStock exchange\n\nWe are interested in the daily change in closing price of a stock, during 100 days. Each day the change can be positive (or zero), or negative.\n\n\nThe daily change on any day can clearly be considered as a binary quantity, say with domain \\(\\set{+, -}\\). The daily changes in 100 days are a set of 100 binary quantities with exactly the same domain – even if each one can have a different value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMars prospecting\n\nSome robot examines 100 similar-sized rocks in a large crater on Mars.

    "text": "13.2 Units, variates, statistical populations\nConsider a large collection of entities that are somehow similar to one another. We call these entities units. These units could be, for instance:\n\nphysical objects such as cars, windmills, planets, or rocks from a particular place;\ncreatures such as animals of a particular species, or human beings, maybe with something in common such as geographical region; or plants of a particular kind;\nautomatons having a particular application;\nsoftware objects such as photos;\nabstract objects such as functions or graphs;\nthe rolls of a particular die or the tosses of a particular coin;\nthe weather conditions in several days.\n\nThese units are similar to one another in that they have some attribute1 common to all. This attribute can present itself in a specific number of mutually-exclusive guises, which can be different from unit to unit. For instance, the attribute could be:1 The term feature is used in machine learning\n\n“colour”, each unit being, say, green, blue, or yellow;\n“mass”, each unit having a mass between \\(0.1\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\) and \\(10\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\);\n“health condition”, each unit (an animal or human in this case) being healthy or ill; or maybe being affected by one of a specific set of diseases;\ncontaining something, for instance a particular chemical substance;\n“having a label”, each unit having one of the labels A, B, C;\na complex combination of several simpler attributes like the ones above.\n\nThe units also have additional attributes (they must, otherwise we wouldn’t be able to distinguish each unit from all others), which we simply don’t consider or can’t measure. We’ll discuss this possibility later.\nFrom this description it’s clear that the attribute of each unit is a quantity, as defined in § 8.1.1. Once the units and their attribute are specified, we have a set of as many quantities as there are units. All these quantities have identical domains.\nA quantity which is an “attribute” of a set of units is called a variate. So when we speak about a variate it is understood that this is a quantity that appears, replicated, in some set of units.\n\n\nWe call a collection of units so defined a statistical population, or just population when there’s no ambiguity. The number of units is called the size of the population.\nThe notion of statistical population is extremely general and encompassing; so many different things can be thought of as a population. In speaking of “data”, what is often meant is a particular statistical population. The specification of a population requires precision, especially when it is used to draw inferences, as we shall see later. A statistical population has not truly been specified until two things are precisely given:\n\na way to determine whether something is a unit or not: inclusion and exclusion criteria, means of collection, and so on\na definition of the variate considered, its possible values, and how it is measured\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercises\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following descriptions does define a statistical population? explain why it does or does not.\n\nPeople.\nElectronic components produced in a specific assembly line, since the line became operational until its discontinuation, and measured for their electric resistance, with possible values in \\([0\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}, \\infty\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}]\\), and result of a shock test, with possible values \\(\\set{\\texttt{\\small pass}, \\texttt{\\small fail}}\\).\nPeople born in Norway between 1st January 1990 and 31st December 2010.\nThe words contained on all websites of the internet.\nRocks, of volume between 1 cm³ and 1 m³, found in the Schiaparelli crater (as defined by contours on a map), and tested to contain hematite, with possible values \\(\\set{\\texttt{\\small Y}, \\texttt{\\small N}}\\).\n\nBrowse some datasets at the UC Irvine Machine Learning repository. Each dataset is a statistical population. The variate in most of these populations is a joint variate (to be discussed soon), that is, a collection of several variates.\nExamine and discuss the specification of some of those datasets:\n\nIs it well-specified what constitutes a “unit”? Are the criteria for including or excluding datapoints, their origin, and so on, well explained?\nAre the variates well-defined? Is it explained what they mean, how they were measured, what is their domain, and so on?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Subtleties in the notion of statistical population\n\n\n\n\nA statistical population is only a conceptual device to simplify and face some decision or inference problem. There is no objectively-defined population “out there”.\nAny entity, object, person, and so on has characteristic that makes it completely unique (say, its space-time coordinates), otherwise we wouldn’t be able to distinguish it from others. From this point of view any entity is just be a one-member population in itself. If we consider two or more entities as being “similar” and belonging to the same population, it’s because we have decided to disregard some characteristics and focus on some others. This decision is arbitrary, a matter of convention, and depends on the specific inference and decision problem.\nTo “test” whether an entity belong to a given population, means to check if that entity satisfies the agreed-upon definition of that population.\nAny physical entity, object, person, etc. can represent different units in different and even non-overlapping statistical populations. For instance, a 100 cm³ rock found in the Schiaparelli crater on Mars could be a unit in these populations:\n\nRocks, of volume between 1 cm³ and 1 m³, found in the Schiaparelli crater and tested for hematite\nRocks, of volume between 10 cm³ and 200 cm³, found in the Schiaparelli crater and tested for hematite\nRocks, of volume between 10 cm³ and 200 m³, found in any crater on any planet of the solar system, and tested for hematite\nRocks, of volume between 1 cm³ and 1 m³, found in the Schiaparelli crater and measured for the magnitude of their magnetic field.\n\nPopulations a. b. c. above have the same variate but differ in their definition of “unit”. Populations a. and d. have the same definition of unit but different variates. Population b. is a subset of population a.: they have the same variate, and any unit in b. is also a unit in a. Populations a. and c. have some overlap: they have the same variate, and some units of a. are also units of c., and vice versa."

    "text": "14.1 The difference between Probability Theory and Statistics\n“Probability theory” and “statistics” are often mentioned together. We shall soon see why and what are the relationship between them. But first let’s try to define them more precisely:\n\nProbability theory\n\nis the theory that describes and norms the quantification and propagation of uncertainty, as we saw in § 7.1.\n\nStatistics\n\nis the study of collective properties of the variates of populations or, more generally, of collections of data.\n\n\nThere are clear and crucial differences between the two:\n\nThe fact that uncertain about something doesn’t mean that there are populations or replicas involved. We can apply probability theory without doing any statistics.\nIf we have full information about a population – the value of the variate for each unit – then we can calculate summaries and other properties of the variate. And there’s no uncertainty involved: at all times we can exactly calculate any information we like about the variate. So we do statistics but probability theory plays no role (except perhaps in the form of propositional logic).\n\nMany texts do not clearly distinguish between probability and statistics. The distinction is important for us because we will have to solve problems involving the uncertainty about particular statistics, so the two must be kept clearly separate. This distinction was observed by James Clerk Maxwell who used it to develop the theories of statistical mechanics and kinetic theory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For the extra curious\n\n\n\nMaxwell explains the statistical method and its use in the molecular description of matter:\n\nIntroductory Lecture on Experimental Physics\nMolecules\n\n\n\nIn many concrete problems, however, these do theories do go hand in hand and interact. This happens mainly in two non-mutually exclusive ways:\n\nthe statistics of a population give information that can be used in the conditional of an inference\nwe want to draw inferences about some statistics of a population, whose values we don’t know.\n\n\n\nLet’s now discuss some important statistics."

    "section": "14.2 Frequency distributions",
    "text": "14.2 Frequency distributions\nConsider a statistical population of \\(N\\) units, with a variate \\(X\\) having a finite set of \\(K\\) values as domain. To keep things simple let’s just say these values are \\(\\set{1, 2, \\dotsc, K}\\) (without any ordering implied); the discussion applies for any finite set. The variate \\(X\\) could be of any non-continuous type: nominal, ordinal, interval, binary (§  8.2), or of a joint or complex type (§  9). Let’s denote the variate associated with unit \\(i\\) with \\(X_i\\). For instance, we express that unit #3 has variate value \\(5\\) and unit #7 has variate value \\(1\\) by writing\n\\[\nX_3 \\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}5 \\land X_7 \\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}1\n\\quad\\text{\\small or more compactly}\\quad\nX_3 \\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}5,\\ X_7 \\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}1\n\\]\nFor each value \\(a\\) in the domain of the variate, we count how many units in the population have that particular value, let’s call the number we find \\(F_a\\). This is the absolute frequency of the value \\(a\\) in this population. Obviously \\(F_a\\) must be an integer between \\(0\\) and \\(K\\) included. The set of absolute frequencies of all values is called the absolute frequency distribution of the values (or of the variate) in the population. We must have\n\\[\\sum_{a=1}^K F_a = N \\ .\\]\nIt is often useful to give not the absolute count of how many times a value \\(a\\) appears in a population, but the fraction with respect to the population size: \\(f_a \\coloneqq F_a/N\\). This is called the relative frequency of the value \\(a\\). The set of these relative frequencies is the relative frequency distribution, which satisfies\n\\[\\sum_{a=1}^K f_a = 1 \\ .\\]\nIn the following we shall call the relative frequency simply “frequency”.\n\n\nThe frequency distribution of values in a population does not give us full information about the latter, because it doesn’t tell which unit has which value. In many situations, however, this is all we need to know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise\n\n\n\nA statistical population is defined as follows:\n\nunits: the bookings at a specific hotel during a specific time period\nvariate: the market segment of the booking\nvariate domain: the set of five values \\(\\set{\\texttt{\\small Offline},\\  \\texttt{\\small Online},\\  \\texttt{\\small Corporate},\\  \\texttt{\\small Aviation},\\  \\texttt{\\small Complementary},\\  \\texttt{\\small Complementary}}\\)\n\nThe population data is stored in this csv file. Each row of the file corresponds to a unit, and lists the unit id (this is not a variate in the present population) and the market segment.\nUse any method you like (a script in your favourite programming language, counting by hand, or whatever) to answer these questions:\n\nHow many units are in the population?\nWhat are the absolute frequencies of the five values?\nWhat are their relative frequencies?\nWhich units have the value \\(\\texttt{\\small Corporate}\\)?\n\n\n\n\nDifferences between frequencies and probabilities\nThe fact that frequencies are non-negative and sum up to 1 makes them somewhat similar to probabilities from a purely numerical point of view. The two notions, however, are completely different and have different uses. Here is a list of some important differences:\n\n\nNot few works in machine learning tend to call “probabilities” any set of positive numbers that sum up to one. Be careful when reading them. Mentally replace probability with degree of belief and see if the text mentioning “probabilities” still makes sense.\n\n\nA probability expresses a degree of belief.\nA frequency is just the count of how many times something appears.\n\n\nThe probability of a sentence depends on an agent’s state of knowledge and background information. Two agents can assign different probabilities to the same sentence.\nThe frequency of a value in a population is an objective physical quantity. All agents agree on the frequency (if they know it).\n\n\n\n\nProbabilities refer to sentences.\nFrequencies refer to values in a population, not to sentences (unless we are speaking of how many times a sentence appears in, say, a book; but this is a completely different and peculiar case.)\n\n\nA probability can refer to a specific unit in a population. An agent can consider, for instance, the probability that the variate for unit #7 has value 3.\nA frequency cannot refer to a specific unit in a population. It is somewhat meaningless to “count how many times the value 3 appears in unit #7”.\n\n\n\n\nLimit frequencies\nIn discussing statistical populations we said (§ 16.1) that we shall often focus on practically infinite populations, that is, populations whose number of units is much larger than the number which will be used as data or on which inferences will be drawn.\nRelative frequencies are ratios of two integers, the denominator being the population size \\(N\\). So a frequency \\(f\\) can only take on \\(N+1\\) rational values \\(0/N, \\dotsc, N/N\\) between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). As the population size increases, the number of distinct, possible frequencies increases and eventually can be considered practically continuous. Frequencies in this case are sometimes called limit frequencies and they are treated as real numbers between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\)."

In terms of conditional frequencies, this means\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&f(\\mathit{Ca}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small low} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathit{Type}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small headlamps}) = 1\n\\\\\n&f(\\mathit{Ca}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small medium} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathit{Type}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small headlamps}) = 0\n\\\\\n&f(\\mathit{Ca}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small high} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathit{Type}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small headlamps}) = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIt is therefore impossible to observe other values of \\(\\mathit{Ca}\\) in this new population.11 We are not claiming that this fact will be true if new units are considered; this important question will be discussed later.\nOn the other hand, if we extract the subpopulation having variate \\(\\mathit{Ca}\\) equal to low we obtain\n\n\nTable 15.5: Selection according to \\(\\mathit{Ca}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small low}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunit\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{}}\\mathit{Ca}\\)\n\\(\\mathit{Si}\\)\n\\(\\mathit{Type}\\)\n\n\n\n\n1\nlow\nhigh\nheadlamps\n\n\n2\nlow\nmedium\nbuilding_windows_non_float_processed\n\n\n5\nlow\nmedium\nheadlamps\n\n\n7\nlow\nmedium\nbuilding_windows_non_float_processed\n\n\n8\nlow\nhigh\ntableware\n\n\n\n\nwith conditional frequencies such as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&f(\\mathit{Type}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small headlamps} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathit{Ca}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small low}) = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\\\\n&f(\\mathit{Type}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small tableware} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathit{Ca}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small low}) = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nand so on. The reverse is therefore not true: if \\(\\mathit{Ca}\\) is equal to low, that does not mean that it’s impossible to observe other \\(\\mathit{Type}\\) values besides headlamps. Note especially how these probabilities differ:\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\nf(\\mathit{Ca}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small low} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathit{Type}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small headlamps}) = 1\n\\\\\nf(\\mathit{Type}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small headlamps} \\nonscript\\:\\vert\\nonscript\\:\\mathopen{} \\mathit{Ca}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small low}) = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\nIn the original population we have, figuratively speaking, the following interesting association:\n\\[\n\\mathit{Type}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small headlamps}\\ \\mathrel{\\color[RGB]{34,136,51}\\Rightarrow}\\\n\\mathit{Ca}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small low}\n\\qquad\\text{\\small but}\\qquad\n\\mathit{Ca}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small low}\\  \\mathrel{\\color[RGB]{238,102,119}\\nRightarrow}\\\n\\mathit{Type}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small headlamps}\n\\]\nThis kind of associations is often useful. Suppose for instance that you are asked to pick a unit with \\(\\mathit{Ca}\\) equal to low in the original population; but it’s difficult to measure a unit’s \\(\\mathit{Ca}\\) value, while it’s easy to measure its \\(\\mathit{Type}\\) value. Then you could instead search for a unit having \\(\\mathit{Type}\\) equal to headlamps (easier search), and you would be sure that the unit you found also has \\(\\mathit{Ca}\\) equal to low.\n\n\nThe example above above, where some values of a variate completely exclude some values of another, is extreme. More often we find that there are small or large changes in the frequency distribution of some variate, depending on the subpopulation considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the (marginal) frequency distribution for the \\(\\mathit{Ca}\\) variate for the glass-fragment population of table  15.1, considering this variate to have values low and medium (so we disregard high). Is one value more frequent than the other?\nCalculate the frequency distribution for \\(\\mathit{Ca}\\), conditional on \\(\\mathit{Type}\\mathrel{\\mkern-2.5mu\\textrm{\\small=}\\mkern-2.5mu}\\texttt{\\small tableware}\\) (see table  15.2). How does this frequency distribution differ from the one calculated previously? Come up with possible ways to exploit this difference in concrete applications.\n\n\n\n\nAssociations can be very counter-intuitive\nIt is usually best to assess associations by explicitly calculating all relevant conditional frequencies, rather than jumping to intuitive conclusions after having examined just a few. Here’s an example.\n\n\nConsider the statistical population defined as follows:\n\n\n\n\nunits: all reparations done by a repair company on a particular kind of electronic components, which is extremely delicate and usually very difficult to repair. The population has 26 units (every unit actually represents a batch 100 reparations, so the population really refers to 2600 reparations).\na joint variate, consisting in three binary ones:\n\n\\(\\mathit{\\color[RGB]{102,204,238}Location}\\) of the repair procedure, with values \\(\\texttt{\\small \\color[RGB]{102,204,238}onsite}\\) and \\(\\texttt{\\small

\\(\\texttt{\\small \\color[RGB]{238,102,119}success}\\) and \\(\\texttt{\\small \\color[RGB]{238,102,119}fail}\\).\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.6: Reparations (each row is one unit, representing 100

In concrete inference and decision problems we usually deal with populations that are much larger, and often even potentially infinite; and some of their data might be unknown.\nIn the glass-forensic example (table  13.1), for instance, many more glass fragments could be examined beyond the 10 units reported there, with no clear bound on the total number. We could even extend that population considering glass fragments from past and future crime scenes:\n\n\n\nTable 16.1: Glass fragments, extended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunit\n\\(\\mathit{RI}\\)\n\\(\\mathit{Ca}\\)\n\\(\\mathit{Si}\\)\n\\(\\mathit{Type}\\)\nnotes\n\n\n\n\n1\n\\(1.51888\\)\n\\(9.95\\)\n\\(72.50\\)\ntableware\n\n\n\n2\n\\(1.51556\\)\n\\(9.41\\)\n\\(73.23\\)\nheadlamps\n\n\n\n3\n\\(1.51645\\)\n\\(8.08\\)\n\\(72.65\\)\nbuilding_windows_non_float_processed\n\n\n\n4\n\\(1.52247\\)\n\\(9.76\\)\n\\(70.26\\)\nheadlamps\n\n\n\n5\n\\(1.51909\\)\n\\(8.78\\)\n\\(71.81\\)\nbuilding_windows_float_processed\n\n\n\n6\n\\(1.51590\\)\n\\(8.22\\)\n\\(73.10\\)\nbuilding_windows_non_float_processed\n\n\n\n7\n\\(1.51610\\)\n\\(8.32\\)\n\\(72.69\\)\nvehicle_windows_float_processed\n\n\n\n8\n\\(1.51673\\)\n\\(8.03\\)\n\\(72.53\\)\nbuilding_windows_non_float_processed\n\n\n\n9\n\\(1.51915\\)\n\\(10.09\\)\n\\(72.69\\)\ncontainers\n\n\n\n10\n\\(1.51651\\)\n\\(9.76\\)\n\\(73.61\\)\nheadlamps\n\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n351\n\\(1.52101\\)\n\\(8.75\\)\n\\(71.78\\)\n?\nfrom unsolved-crime scene in 1963\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n1027\n\\(1.51761\\)\n\\(7.83\\)\n\\(72.73\\)\n?\ncrime scene in 2063\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n\n\nthe imaginary example above also shows that the values of some variates for some units might be unknown; this is a situation we shall discuss in depth later.\n\n\nWe shall henceforth focus on statistical populations with a number of units that is in principle infinite, or so large that it can be considered practically infinite. “Practically” means that the number of units we’ll use as data or draw inferences about is a very small fraction, say less than 0.1%, of the total population size.\nThis is often the case. Consider for example (as in § 8.1.1) the collection of all possible 128 × 128 images with 24-bit colour depth. This collection has \\(2^{24 \\times 128 \\times 128} \\approx 10^{118 370}\\) units. Even if we used 100 billions of such images as data, and wanted to draw inferences on another 100 billions, these would constitute only \\(10^{-118 357}\\,\\%\\) of the whole collection. This collection is practically infinite.\nNote that we can’t say whether a population, per se, is “practically infinite” or not. It could be practically infinite for a particular inference problem, but not for another.\nWhen we use the term “population” it will often be understood that we’re speaking about a statistical population that is practically infinite with respect to the inference or decision problem under consideration."

    "text": "16.2 Samples\nIn the glass-forensic example above (table  16.1), the units and data we had initially (table  13.1) have been considered as part or a much larger population. Such a part is called a population sample or “sample” for short. Almost all data considered in engineering and data-science problems can be considered to be population samples.\nIt is extremely important to specify how a sample is extracted from a population. For instance, if we consider table  13.1 to be a full population, we could extract a sample in such a way that \\(\\mathit{Type}\\) only has value \\(\\texttt{\\small headlamps}\\) (similarly to when we construct a subpopulation, §  15.1, but for a subpopulation we would select all units having that variate value). The marginal frequency of the value \\(\\texttt{\\small headlamps}\\) in the sample would then be \\(1\\), whereas in the original population it is \\(3/10 \\approx 0.333\\) – two very different frequencies.\n\n“Representative” and biased samples\nIn inference and decision problems we would like to use samples in which the various frequencies didn’t differ very much from those in the original population. Such a sample is called a “representative sample”. This is a difficult notion; the International Organization for Standardization for instance warns (item 3.1.14):\n\nThe notion of representative sample is fraught with controversy, with some survey practitioners rejecting the term altogether.\n\nIn many cases it is impossible for a sample of given size to be “representative”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise\n\n\n\nConsider the following population of 16 units, with four binary variates \\(W,X,Y,Z\\), each with values \\(0\\) and \\(1\\):\n\n\n\n\nTable 16.2: Four-bit population\n\n\n\\(W\\)\n\\(X\\)\n\\(Y\\)\n\\(Z\\)\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n0\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe joint variate \\((W,X,Y,Z)\\) has 16 possible values, from \\((0,0,0,0)\\) to \\((1,1,1,1)\\). Each of these values appear exactly once in the population, so it has frequency \\(1/16\\). The marginal frequency distribution for each binary variate is also uniform, with frequencies of 50% for both \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\n\nExtract a representative sample of four units. In particular, the marginal frequency distributions of the four variates should be as close to 50%/50% as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously we cannot expect a population sample to exactly reflect all frequency distributions – joint, marginal, conditional – of the original population; some discrepancy is to be expected. How much discrepancy should be allowed? And what is the minimal size for a sample not to exceed such discrepancy?\nInformation Theory gives reasonable answers to these questions; we summarize them here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For the extra curious\n\n\n\n\nChapters 1–10 of Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms\nVideo lectures 1–9 from the Course on Information Theory, Pattern Recognition, and Neural Networks\n\n\n\nFirst we need to define the Shannon entropy of a discrete frequency distribution. Lets say the distribution is \\((f_1,f_2, \\dotsc)\\). Its Shannon entropy \\(H(f)\\) is then defined as\n\\[\nH(f) \\coloneqq-\\sum_{i} f_i\\ \\log_2 f_i\n\\qquad\\text{\\color[RGB]{119,119,119}\\small(with \\(0\\cdot\\log 0 \\coloneqq 0\\))}\n\\]\nand is measured in bits (when the base of the logarithm is 2).\nIf we have a population with joint frequency \\(f\\), then a representative sample from it must have at least size\n\\[\n2^{H(f)} \\equiv\n\\frac{1}{{f_1}^{f_1}\\cdot {f_2}^{f_2}\\cdot {f_3}^{f_3}\\cdot \\dotsb}\n\\] \nThis particular number has important practical consequences; for example it is related to the maximum rate at which a communication channel can send symbols (which can be considered as values of a variate) with an error as low as we please.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the Shannon entropy of the joint frequency distribution for the four-bit population of table  16.2.\nCalculate the minimum representative-sample size according to the Shannon-entropy formula. Is the result intuitive?\n\n\n\n\n\nBiases\nFor many populations it is difficult or impossible to obtain a “representative” sample, even when the sample is large. As the exercises above show, this impossibility remains even if we extract the sample in an unsystematic and unpredictable way (“random sample”), by shuffling or similar techniques.\nA sample that presents some aspects, such as frequency distributions, which are at variance with the original population, is sometimes called biased (this term is used in many different ways by different authors). Unfortunately, most samples are “biased” in this sense."

Now we shall finally use them together in more realistic scenarios. But before continuing let us summarize what we have learned so far; also to motivate why those two topics have been kept separated.\nOn the “inference side” we first gave a concrete and operational meaning to “drawing an inference”, as the calculation of the probability – the degree of belief – of some sentence from the probability of others. This means that in principle we can draw inferences and apply the probability calculus to literally anything that can be expressed by language.\nWe also saw the following points:\n\nThe calculation of probabilities only uses four fundamental – and mathematically quite simple – rules (§  7.4). Any inference, even those make by the most complex machine-learning algorithms, is just a repeated application of those four rules (sometimes with approximating shortcuts for the sake of speed).\nNo inference can be drawn unless some probabilities are first posited as a starting point. This is just another face of the formal-logic fact that no theorem (besides tautologies) can be derived, unless some axioms are given first.\nThe four fundamental rules are determined by basic requirements of logical consistency. Modifying the rules would lead to inconsistent inferences and sub-optimal decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart BT\n  A[quantity] --o B([sentences]) --&gt; C{{probability calculus}}\n  D[value] ---o B\n  E[population] --o B\n  F[...] -..-o B\n  G[(problem)] --x A & D & E\n  G[(problem)] -.-x F\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the “data side” we introduced a set of notions, such as “quantity”, “having a value”, “domain”, “quantity type”, “population”, “variate”, “frequency”. We learned how to use them and paid attention to some of their counter-intuitive properties.\nThese notions allow us to speak, in a precise way, about typical situations and problems that arise in engineering and other scientific contexts. In essence all we did was to introduce a particular kind of sentences to express engineering problems – so we can apply the probability calculus to them and draw inferences about them.\nThis specific language has its roots in physics and mathematics, where it has been successfully used and refined for several centuries. But it might evolve in different directions in the future, to make allowance for new inferential problems. Later we shall indeed expand it in a couple of directions to cover particular operations that we do with data."

    "text": "18.1 Induction\nIt is a fact of everyday experience that we expect things to happen in particular ways because of our previous experience with similar things. If we observe that ten electronic components in a row come out damaged from an assembly line, then we expect that the next one will be damaged as well. If you regularly go hiking in a particular area and often see deer, and sometimes hares, then you think it likely to see deer also at your next hike and, if you’re lucky, a hare. You would probably be surprised to see a moose if you had never seen one in those areas. This doesn’t only concern the future: if someone asks you whether you saw a deer during a hike from long time ago, which you don’t quite remember anymore, you’d say “probably I did”.\nThis familiar experience is called induction, especially in the philosophical literature. It has generated a lot of thought and research since the times of Hume (18th century), who apparently was the first to ask how and why this experience is possible.\nBut this kind of regularities does not have clear-cut circumstances. In some cases it is not clear what should be considered “similar” things – in fact, sometimes we circularly reverse the reasoning: if something does not respect an observed regularity then we say it wasn’t “similar”. Also the circumstances in which this regularity should occur are often not-well-defined: should you expect to see deer if you hike in a somewhat different area?\nAnd sometimes this kind of regularities simply fails. Something expected doesn’t happen any longer, even if the circumstances and the “similarity” are clearly the same. Jeffreys aptly said:\n\nA common argument for induction is that induction has always worked in the past and therefore may be expected to hold in the future. It has been objected that this is itself an inductive argumentand cannot be used in support of induction. What is hardly ever mentioned is that induction has often failed in the past and that progress in science is very largely the consequence of direct attention to instances where the inductive method has led to incorrect predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For the extra curious\n\n\n\nChapter I of Scientific Inference\n\n\n\n\nInduction, with the mentioned caveats that accompany it, is at the basis of how we approach and solve many engineering problems, and at the heart of data science: from data about particular things or phenomena we try to infer new or old instances of “similar” things or phenomena.\nWe shall now see how this is done in a quantitative manner with the probability calculus. It is important to clarify what the probability calculus, and all approximate inference methods derived from it, can and cannot do:"

    "text": "18.2 Exchangeable inferences\n\nIntuitive understanding\nConsider these sketches of two inference problems:\n\n\nStock exchange\n\nIn 100 days, the daily change in closing price of a stock has been positive 74 times, and negative 26 times, according a particular sequence. For instance, the data could be:\n\n\n\nIn which of the subsequent 3 days will the closing-price change be positive, and in which negative?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMars prospecting\n\nOf the last 100 similar-sized rocks examined in a large crater on Mars, 74 contained hematite, and 26 didn’t. For instance, the data could be:\n\n\n\nwhere “Y” and “N” denote the presence and absence of hematite.\nWhich, among the next 3 rocks that will be examined, will contain hematite, and which will be hematite-free?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise\n\n\n\nDiscuss:\n\nWhich of the two inferences above seems more difficult?…\n…Why? Speculate on which factors make one inference more difficult than the other.\nWhich differences and similarities do you find between the two inferences?\nWhich additional information could be important for drawing more precise inferences?\nWhich type of quantities appear in the two inferences?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two inference problems differ in some aspects and are similar in others. Time, for example, appears to be an important aspect of the first inference, which is in fact often categorized as a “time-series analysis”. But the second inference involves or could involve time as well: the rocks could be inspected sequentially. So more precisely it is the time ordering that is more relevant in the first inference than the second.\nAn important difference between the two inference problems is revealed by the following thought-experiments. Consider how you would answer in the stock-exchange case and in the Mars-prospecting case:\n\nIt turns out that there was an error in the sequence of positive and negative datapoints, although not in the total amounts of positive and negative ones. In the stock-exchange inference, for instance, days 1 (\\(-\\)) and 3 (\\(+\\)) were erroneously swapped, as were days 100 (\\(+\\)) and 85 (\\(-\\)), and many other days; in the Mars-prospecting inference, rocks #1 (Y) and #3 (N) were erroneously swapped, as were rocks #100 (Y) and #97 (N), and many other rocks.\nShould the final inference about the next 3 datapoints be changed?\nThe information about the exact sequence of data is lost, and only the total amount of positive and negative datapoints is preserved (74 vs 26).\nWould the final inference about the next 3 datapoints be different, compared to the situation where the exact data sequence is known?\nA new inference is requested: not about the 3 datapoints following the known data, but the 3 datapoints preceding the known data: the day before day 1 and so on, or the rock before rock #1 and so on. (Or, generalizing: an inference about 3 datapoints interspersed among the known ones is requested.)\nWould the inference for the preceding 3 datapoints be different from the original one about the subsequent 3 datapoints?\n\nIn all these thought-experiments, our intuition is that the inference for the stock-exchange problem would be different, but the one for the Mars-prospecting problem would stay the same or not change appreciably. Swapping days in a stock course, matters; swapping rocks in a crater, doesn’t. There are good reasons, based on physics and dynamical-system theory, for this intuition.\nAn inference which does not change if data and unknown quantities are freely reordered, like the Mars-prospecting one, is called exchangeable. Whereas an inference in which the ordering of data and unknowns is relevant, like the stock-exchange one, is called non-exchangeable. There is not a dichotomy between the two cases; rather, there are continuous varying degrees of exchangeability or non-exchangeability. But for the moment we shall simplify this gradation into a binary distinction.\nWe shall now make this definition more precise, and then study and exploit the remarkable consequences that it has for an agent’s inferences and probability calculations."

    "text": "19.1 Exchangeable inferences\n\nIntuitive understanding\nConsider these sketches of two inference problems:\n\n\nStock exchange\n\nIn 100 days, the daily change in closing price of a stock has been positive 74 times, and negative 26 times, according a particular sequence. For instance, the data could be:\n\n\n\nIn which of the subsequent 3 days will the closing-price change be positive, and in which negative?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMars prospecting\n\nOf the last 100 similar-sized rocks examined in a large crater on Mars, 74 contained hematite, and 26 didn’t. For instance, the data could be:\n\n\n\nwhere “Y” and “N” denote the presence and absence of hematite.\nWhich, among the next 3 rocks that will be examined, will contain hematite, and which will be hematite-free?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise\n\n\n\nDiscuss:\n\nWhich of the two inferences above seems more difficult?…\n…Why? Speculate on which factors make one inference more difficult than the other.\nWhich differences and similarities do you find between the two inferences?\nWhich additional information could be important for drawing more precise inferences?\nWhich type of quantities appear in the two inferences?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two inference problems differ in some aspects and are similar in others. Time, for example, appears to be an important aspect of the first inference, which is in fact often categorized as a “time-series analysis”. But the second inference involves or could involve time as well: the rocks could be inspected sequentially. So more precisely it is the time ordering that is more relevant in the first inference than the second.\nAn important difference between the two inference problems is revealed by the following thought-experiments. Consider how you would answer in the stock-exchange case and in the Mars-prospecting case:\n\nIt turns out that there was an error in the sequence of positive and negative datapoints, although not in the total amounts of positive and negative ones. In the stock-exchange inference, for instance, days 1 (\\(-\\)) and 3 (\\(+\\)) were erroneously swapped, as were days 100 (\\(+\\)) and 85 (\\(-\\)), and many other days; in the Mars-prospecting inference, rocks #1 (Y) and #3 (N) were erroneously swapped, as were rocks #100 (Y) and #97 (N), and many other rocks.\nShould the final inference about the next 3 datapoints be changed?\nThe information about the exact sequence of data is lost, and only the total amount of positive and negative datapoints is preserved (74 vs 26).\nWould the final inference about the next 3 datapoints be different, compared to the situation where the exact data sequence is known?\nA new inference is requested: not about the 3 datapoints following the known data, but the 3 datapoints preceding the known data: the day before day 1 and so on, or the rock before rock #1 and so on. (Or, generalizing: an inference about 3 datapoints interspersed among the known ones is requested.)\nWould the inference for the preceding 3 datapoints be different from the original one about the subsequent 3 datapoints?\n\nIn all these thought-experiments, our intuition is that the inference for the stock-exchange problem would be different, but the one for the Mars-prospecting problem would stay the same or not change appreciably. Swapping days in a stock course, matters; swapping rocks in a crater, doesn’t. There are good reasons, based on physics and dynamical-system theory, for this intuition.\nAn inference which does not change if data and unknown quantities are freely reordered, like the Mars-prospecting one, is called exchangeable. Whereas an inference in which the ordering of data and unknowns is relevant, like the stock-exchange one, is called non-exchangeable. There is not a dichotomy between the two cases; rather, there are continuous varying degrees of exchangeability or non-exchangeability. But for the moment we shall simplify this gradation into a binary distinction.\nWe shall now make this definition more precise, and then study and exploit the remarkable consequences that it has for an agent’s inferences and probability calculations."

We’ll consider this possibility later.\nAs you see, your imagination is the only limit of what can be considered a “collection of units” and their “aspect”.\nWe consider collections with a number of units that is in principle infinite, or so large that it can be considered practically infinite. It can be considered practically infinite if the number of units we’ll use as data or draw inferences about is a very small fraction, say less than 0.1%, of the total number of units.\nThis is often the case. Consider for example (as in § 8.1.1) the collection of all possible 128 × 128 images with 24-bit colour depth. This collection has \\(2^{24 \\times 128 \\times 128} \\approx 10^{118 370}\\) units. Even if we used 100 billions of such images as data, and wanted to draw inferences on another 100 billions, these would constitute only \\(10^{-118 357}\\,\\%\\) of the whole collection. This collection is practically infinite.\nWe’ll call a collection thus defined a population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Exercise"

    "text": "\\[\n\\DeclarePairedDelimiters{\\set}{\\{}{\\}}\n\\]\n\nSo far we have learned about concepts of doing inference, and about various properties of data. Now it is time to combine the two, and create a mathematical model that can use data from the past to make predictions about the unknown. Machine learning methods can be wildly different both in terms of operation and complexity, but they all behave as functions that take in a data point \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), a set of values \\(\\theta\\) which we call parameters, and returns the prediction \\(y\\):\n\\[\n    y = f(\\mathbf{x}, \\theta).\n\\]\nThe prediction \\(y\\) can be any quantity discussed in § 8.2 – most commonly we want to classify the data (and we say we are doing classification), or we want to estimate some value (in which case we call it regression).\nAs engineers, when faced with the task of using data to model the behaviour of some system, our job is twofold. First, we need to select a suitable method to serve as the function \\(f\\), and second, we need to find the optimal values for the parameters \\(\\theta\\). In ADA501 we will see how to choose an analytical \\(f\\) that corresponds to certain physical systems, while in our course, we will look at methods where \\(f\\) can be practically anything. In fact, we will not even require \\(f\\) to be a deterministic function – consider for instance generative models like ChatGPT or DALL-E, which creates different outputs for the same input, each time it is run.\nFinding the parameters \\(\\theta\\) is what takes us from a general method, to the specific solution to a problem. As we will see, the way of finding them differs between the various machine learning methods, but the principle is always the same: We need to choose a loss function, and then iteratively adjust \\(\\theta\\) so that the loss, when computed on known data, becomes as small as possible. The loss function should represent the difference between what the model outputs, and the correct answer – the better the model, the smaller the difference. The choice of this loss function depends on what kind of problem we wish to solve, and we will look at the common ones shortly. But at this point we can already define the three main types of machine learning:\n\nIf we know the “correct answers” (the labels) for all entries in our data set, this is what the model should aim to learn, and we call it supervised learning.\nIf we do not have the data labels, we can still write a loss function corresponding to what we want the model to do with the data. Most commonly, we want to find groups, or clusters, of similar-looking data points. If we provide a way of computing scores for good clusters, the model is left to find cluster labels by it self, and we call it unsupervised learning.\nIf the decision of a model on one data point affects the value of future data points, like for a self-driving car that may turn left and crash, or turn right and follow the road, we need a loss function that penalises certain actions and rewards others. This is called reinforcement learning."
