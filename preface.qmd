## Mechanics and engineers

What is the difference between a *car mechanic* and an *automotive engineer*?

Both have knowledge about cars, but their knowledge domains are different and focus on different goals.

A car mechanic can keep your car in top-notch condition; can do different kinds of easy and difficult repairs if problems arise with it; knows whether a particular brand of valve can be used as a replacement for another brand; can recommend the optimal kind of tyres to use in a given season for different brands of cars. But a car mechanic would face difficulties in calculating the theoretical maximal efficiency of an engine; or predicting the temperature increase caused by a new kind of fuel;  or exploiting the phase transition of a new kind of foam to design a safer airbag system; or calculating the optimal surface curvature for a spoiler. A car mechanic typically possesses a large amount of case-specific knowledge, and doesn't need to know in depth the principles of electromechanics and thermochemistry, or the laws of balance of momentum, energy, entropy.

Vice versa, an automotive engineer can assess how to use the electromechanical properties of a new material in order to design a more efficient and environmentally friendly engine; can calculate how a new material-surface handling would affect air drag and speed; and ultimately can research how to exploit new physical phenomena to build completely new means of transportation. Yet, an automotive engineer could be completely incapable of changing a pipe in your car, or tell you whether it can use a particular brand of lubricant oil. An automotive engineer typically possesses knowledge about the principles of electromagnetism, mechanics, or thermochemistry; is acquainted with relevant physical laws; and doesn't need to have in-depth case-specific kinds of knowledge.

Note that the differences just sketched *do not imply a judgement of value*. Both professions, kinds of knowledge, and goals are necessary, interesting, and couldn't exist without each other. Choice between them is a subjective matter of personal passions and aspirations.

In fact there isn't a clear divide between these two kinds of knowledge, but rather a continuum between two vague extremities. A car mechanic can have knowledge and insight about new technologies, and an automotive engineer can know how to fix a carburettor. The two sketches above are meant to expose and emphasize the existence of such a continuum of knowledge and of goals.


## Data mechanics and data engineers

A continuum with two similar extremities can also be drawn in [**data science**]{.blue}.

Some data scientists have in-depth knowledge on, for instance, how to optimally store and read large amounts data; what kind of machine-learning algorithm to use in a given task; how to fine-tune an algorithm's parameters, and the currently best software for this purpose. Their particular knowledge is fundamental for the working of today's technological infrastructure.

At the same time, these data scientists typically face difficulties, for instance, in:

- calculating the theoretical maximal accuracy or performance achievable -- by *any* possible algorithm -- in a given inference problem

- explaining how the fundamental rules of inference and decision-making are implemented in a particular machine-learning algorithm

- identifying which sub-optimal approximations to the fundamental rules are made by popular machine-learning algorithms

- exploiting new technologies to build new algorithms that do calculations closer to the exact theoretical ones, thereby achieving a performance closer to the theoretical optimum

And it is also possible that they are not aware of, and maybe would be surprised by, some basic facts of data science. For instance:

- there is an optimal, universal inference & decision algorithm, of which all machine-learning algorithms (from support vector machines and deep networks to random forests and large language models), are an approximation

- there are only five or six fundamental laws upon which any inference, prediction, classification, regression, decision task is (or ought to be) based upon

- splittings of data into "training set", "validation set", and similar sets, are not part of the exact application of the laws of inference and decision-making; such splittings arise as coarse approximations of the exact method.

- cross-validation and related techniques are not part of the exact method either; they also arise as approximations

- overfitting, underfitting and related notions are not problems that appear in the exact method (which takes care of them automatically); they also arise from approximations

- it is possible to calculate, within probable bounds, the maximal accuracy (or other performance metric) achievable by *any* classification or regression algorithm for a given application

- some evaluation metrics, such as precision or the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), have intrinsic flaws and may attribute higher values to worse-performing algorithms

...because this is a kind of general and principled knowledge that these data scientists don't need in their jobs. Their knowledge is more case-specific.

Drawing a parallel with the car example, a data scientist with this kind of case-specific knowledge is like a "data mechanic".

A "data engineer", on the other hand, is the kind of data scientist who has no difficulties with the knowledge and skills implicit in the bullet points above; but at the same time might not know what software to use for tuning parameters of a particular class of deep networks, or the best format to store particular kinds of data.

Just like in the case of the automotive industry, the difference just sketched does *not* imply any judgement of value. Both kinds of knowledge and goals are important and can't exist without each other.

## Goals of this course

There is a plethora of academic courses, in all kinds of format, that target knowledge and goals for the "data mechanic". Those courses are usually inadequate to cover the knowledge and goals for the "data engineer". Some courses, misleadingly, even present approximations and recipes that are only valid for particular situations as if they were universal rules or methods instead.

<!-- For example, if you have some acquaintance with machine learning through a "data mechanic" course, you might be surprised by the following facts: -->

Courses that target the "data engineer" seem to be more rare. One possible reason is that this kind of knowledge is actually hidden in courses on probability, statistics, and risk analysis, presented with a language which makes only opaque and confusing connections with fields in data science and their goals; or, worse, with a language which emphasizes connections that are actually superficial and misleading.

We believe that it is important to teach and keep alive the less "mechanic" and more "engineer" side of data science:

- Continuous advances in computational technology -- think of quantum computers -- will offer completely novel and superior ways to approximate the exact method of inference and decision. Only the data scientist who knows the exact method and theory, and understands how present-day algorithms approximate it, will be able to exploit new technologies.
- Even without looking at the future, several present-day machine-learning algorithms could already be greatly optimized by any data engineer who is acquainted with the basic principles underlying data science.
- The foundations of data science are the bridge to the sibling discipline of Artificial Intelligence.

The present course aspires to give an introduction to the "data engineer" side, rather than "data mechanic" one, of data science, but using a point of view more familiar to data scientists than to, say, statisticians.

More details about its aims, structure, and features are already given in the [*Dear student*](index.html) introduction.










<!-- - "Engineering based on data" is just how engineering and science in general have been in the past 400 years or so. Nothing new there. -->

<!-- - The amount of available data has changed. This may lead to a reduction -- or in some cases an increase -- in uncertainty, and therefore to different solutions. -->

<!-- - Luckily the fundamental theory to deal with large amount of data is exactly the same to deal with small amounts. So the foundations haven't changed. -->

<!-- This course makes you acquainted with the foundations. -->

> Many results of science that we readily believe are in fact quite extraordinary claims. Take a moment to reflect on how unbelievable the following propositions would have appeared to a keen and intelligent observer of nature from 500 years ago. The earth is very old, well over 4 billion years of age; it exists in a near-vacuum and revolves around the sun, which is about 150 million kilometers away; in the sun a great deal of energy is produced by nuclear fusion, the same kind of process as the explosion of a hydrogen bomb; all material objects are made up of invisible molecules and atoms, which are in turn made up of elementary particles, all far too small ever to be seen or felt directly; in each cell of a living creature there is a hypercomplex molecule called DNA, which largely determines the shape and functioning of the organism; and so on. Most members of today's educated public subscribing to the "Western" civilization would assent to most of these propositions without hesitation, teach them confidently to their children, and become indignant when some ignorant people question these truths. However, if they were asked to say why they believe these items of scientific common sense, most would be unable to produce any convincing arguments. It may even be that the more basic and firm the belief is, the more stumped we tend to feel in trying to justify it. Such a correlation would indicate that unquestioning belief has served as a substitute for genuine understanding.

> It is neither desirable nor any longer effective to try bullying people into accepting the authority of science. Instead, all members of the educated public can be invited to participate in science, in order to experience the true nature and value of scientific inquiry. This does not mean listening to professional scientists tell condescending stories about how they have discovered wonderful things, which you should believe for reasons that are too difficult for you to understand in real depth and detail. Doing science ought to mean asking your own questions, making your own investigations, and drawing your own conclusions for your own reasons. Of course it will not be feasible to advance the "cutting edge" or "frontier"" of modern science without first acquiring years of specialist training. However, the cutting edge is not all there is to science, nor is it necessarily the most valuable part of science. Questions that have been answered are still worth asking again, so you can understand for yourself how to arrive at the standard answers, and possibly discover new answers or recover forgotten answers that are valuable.
