## Subpopulations {#sec-subpopulations}

When we have a statistical population with a joint variate, it is often of interest to focus on a subset of units that share the same value of a particular variate.

Consider for instance the following population, related to the glass-forensics example we encountered before:

:::{.column-margin}
![](glass_fragments.jpg){width=100%}
:::

- *units:* glass fragments (collected at specific locations)
- *variate:* the joint variate $(\vCa, \vSi, \vType)$ consisting of three simple variates:
	+ weight fraction of $\vCa$lcium in the fragment (ordinal variate), with three possible values $\set{\cat{low}, \cat{medium}, \cat{high}}$
	+ weight fraction of $\vSi$licon in the fragment (ordinal variate), with three possible values $\set{\cat{low}, \cat{medium}, \cat{high}}$
    + $\vType$ of glass fragment (nominal variate), with seven possible values $\{\cat{building_windows_float_processed}$, $\cat{building_windows_non_float_processed}$, $\cat{containers}$, $\cat{tableware}$, $\cat{headlamps}\}$


| [unit]{.yellow}  |    $\vCa$  |    $\vSi$  |                                $\vType$  |
|:--:|:------:|:------:|:------------------------------------:|
|    [1]{.yellow}  |     $\cat{low}$  |    $\cat{high}$  |                             $\cat{headlamps}$  |
|    [2]{.yellow}  |     $\cat{low}$  |  $\cat{medium}$  |  $\cat{building_windows_non_float_processed}$  |
|    [3]{.yellow}  |  $\cat{medium}$  |  $\cat{medium}$  |                             $\cat{tableware}$  |
|    [4]{.yellow}  |  $\cat{medium}$  |  $\cat{medium}$  |      $\cat{building_windows_float_processed}$  |
|    [5]{.yellow}  |     $\cat{low}$  |  $\cat{medium}$  |                             $\cat{headlamps}$  |
|    [6]{.yellow}  |  $\cat{medium}$  |  $\cat{medium}$  |                            $\cat{containers}$  |
|    [7]{.yellow}  |     $\cat{low}$  |  $\cat{medium}$  |  $\cat{building_windows_non_float_processed}$  |
|    [8]{.yellow}  |     $\cat{low}$  |    $\cat{high}$  |                             $\cat{tableware}$  |
|    [9]{.yellow}  |  $\cat{medium}$  |  $\cat{medium}$  |                             $\cat{tableware}$  |
|   [10]{.yellow}  |  $\cat{medium}$  |  $\cat{medium}$  |                             $\cat{tableware}$  |
: Simplified glass-fragment population data {#tbl-glass-simple .sm}


Let's say we are interested only in units that have the $\vType$ variate equal to $\cat{tableware}$. Discarding all others we obtain a new, smaller population with four units:

| [unit]{.yellow}  |    $\vCa$  |    $\vSi$  |                 $\boldsymbol{\|}\vType$  |
|:--:|:------:|:------:|:------------------------------------:|
|    [3]{.yellow}  |  $\cat{medium}$  |  $\cat{medium}$  |                             $\cat{tableware}$  |
|    [8]{.yellow}  |     $\cat{low}$  |    $\cat{high}$  |                             $\cat{tableware}$  |
|    [9]{.yellow}  |  $\cat{medium}$  |  $\cat{medium}$  |                             $\cat{tableware}$  |
|   [10]{.yellow}  |  $\cat{medium}$  |  $\cat{medium}$  |                             $\cat{tableware}$  |
: Selection according to $\vType\mo \cat{tableware}$ {#tbl-glass-tableware .sm}

were a bar "$\boldsymbol{\|}$" indicates the variate used for the selection.


As another example, we could be interested instead in those units that have *both* $\vCa$ *and* $\vSi$ variates equal to $\cat{medium}$. We obtain a smaller population with five units:

| [unit]{.yellow}  |  $\boldsymbol{\|}\vCa$  |        $\boldsymbol{\|}\vSi$  |                                $\vType$  |
|:--:|:------:|:------:|:------------------------------------:|
|    [3]{.yellow}  |  $\cat{medium}$               |  $\cat{medium}$                     |                             $\cat{tableware}$  |
|    [4]{.yellow}  |  $\cat{medium}$               |  $\cat{medium}$                     |      $\cat{building_windows_float_processed}$  |
|    [6]{.yellow}  |  $\cat{medium}$               |  $\cat{medium}$                     |                            $\cat{containers}$  |
|    [9]{.yellow}  |  $\cat{medium}$               |  $\cat{medium}$                     |                             $\cat{tableware}$  |
|   [10]{.yellow}  |  $\cat{medium}$               |  $\cat{medium}$                     |                             $\cat{tableware}$  |
: Selection according to $\vCa\mo \cat{medium}$ and $\vSi\mo \cat{medium}$ {#tbl-glass-ca-si-medium .sm}



Populations formed in this way are called [**subpopulations**]{.blue} of the original one. They are statistical populations in their own right. The notion of "subpopulation" is a relative notion. Any population can often be considered as a subpopulation of some larger population having additional variates.

:::{.callout-caution}
## {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise
- From the population of [table @tbl-glass-simple]:
    + Construct the *marginal* population with variate $\vCa$
    + Report the frequency distribution for the marginal population above (remember that $\vCa$ has *three* possible values)
    + Construct the subpopulation with variate $\vSi$ equal to $\cat{high}$
    + Construct the subpopulation with variate $\vType$ equal to $\cat{headlamps}$ and the variate $\vSi$ equal to $\cat{medium}$


*Check your understanding of the reasoning behind the notions of marginal population and subpopulation with this exercise:*

- From the population of [table @tbl-glass-simple], construct the subpopulation with variate $\vType$ equal to *either* $\cat{headlamps}$ *or* $\cat{tableware}$.
:::



## Conditional frequencies {#sec-conditional-freqs}

Given a statistical population with joint variates ${\green X}, {\red Y}$ (and possibly others), we define the [**conditional frequency**]{.blue} of the value ${\red y}$ of  ${\red Y}$, given or "conditional on" the value ${\green x}$ of  ${\green X}$, as the frequency of the value ${\red y}$ in the subpopulation selected by ${\green X\mo x}$. This frequency is usually written

$$
f({\red Y\mo y} \| {\green X\mo x})
$$

where $f$ is the symbol for the joint frequency of the population.

Consider for instance the glass-fragment population of [table @tbl-glass-simple]. The conditional frequency of ${\red\vCa\mo \cat{low}}$ given ${\green\vType\mo \cat{tableware}}$ is the (marginal) frequency of $\vCa\mo \cat{low}$ in the subpopulation of [table @tbl-glass-tableware], from which we find

$$
f({\red \vCa\mo \cat{low}} \| {\green \vType\mo \cat{tableware}}) = \frac{1}{4}
$$

The collection of these conditional frequencies for all values of ${\red Y}$ constitutes the [conditional frequency distribution]{.blue} of ${\red Y}$ conditional on ${\green X\mo x}$. In our example this distribution has three conditional frequencies:

$$\begin{aligned}
&f({\red \vCa\mo \cat{low}} \| {\green \vType\mo \cat{tableware}}) = \frac{1}{4}
\\
&f({\red \vCa\mo \cat{medium}} \| {\green \vType\mo \cat{tableware}}) = \frac{3}{4}
\\
&f({\red \vCa\mo \cat{high}} \| {\green \vType\mo \cat{tableware}}) = 0
\end{aligned}$$

which sum up to $1$ as they should.

:::{.callout-important}
## {{< fa exclamation-triangle >}} Conditional on a *value* of a variate

It doesn't make sense to speak of the conditional frequency distribution of $Y$ "conditional [on $X$"]{.yellow}. Conditional frequencies and frequency distributions are always conditional on some value of a variate. If we consider all possible values of $Y$ *and* of $X$ we obtain a collection of frequencies that is *not* a distribution.
:::

A conditional frequency can be calculated as the ratio of a joint and a marginal frequencies, in a way analogous to conditional probabilities ([§@sec-conditional-probs]):

$$
f({\red Y\mo y} \| {\green X\mo x}) =
\frac{f({\red Y\mo y} \and {\green X\mo x})}{f({\green X\mo x})} =
\frac{f({\red Y\mo y} \and {\green X\mo x})}{
\sum_{\red y} f({\red Y\mo y} \and {\green X\mo x})}
$$

## Associations {#sec-association}

The analysis of subpopulations and conditional frequencies is important because it often reveals peculiar [*associations*]{.blue}^[In everyday language this is the same as "correlation". The term "association" is used in statistics to avoid confusion with the Pearson correlation coefficient (see [§@sec-entropy-mutualinfo])] among different variates and groups of variates. Let's illustrate what we mean by "association" with an example.

Extract the subpopulation having variate $\vType$ equal to $\cat{headlamps}$ from the population of [table @tbl-glass-simple]:

| [unit]{.yellow}  |    $\vCa$  |    $\vSi$  |                 $\boldsymbol{\|}\vType$  |
|:--:|:------:|:------:|:------------------------------------:|
|    [1]{.yellow}  |     $\cat{low}$  |    $\cat{high}$  |                             $\cat{headlamps}$  |
|    [5]{.yellow}  |     $\cat{low}$  |  $\cat{medium}$  |                             $\cat{headlamps}$  |
: Selection according to $\vType\mo \cat{headlamps}$ {#tbl-glass-headlamps .sm}

we notice that all units have variate $\vCa$ equal to $\cat{low}$. In terms of conditional frequencies, this means

$$
\begin{aligned}
&f(\vCa\mo\cat{low} \| \vType\mo\cat{headlamps}) = 1
\\
&f(\vCa\mo\cat{medium} \| \vType\mo\cat{headlamps}) = 0
\\
&f(\vCa\mo\cat{high} \| \vType\mo\cat{headlamps}) = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

It is therefore impossible to observe other values of $\vCa$ in this new population.^[We are not claiming that this fact will be true if new units are considered; this important question will be discussed later.]

On the other hand, if we extract the subpopulation having variate $\vCa$ equal to $\cat{low}$ we obtain

| [unit]{.yellow}  |    $\boldsymbol{\|}\vCa$  |    $\vSi$  |                                $\vType$  |
|:--:|:------:|:------:|:------------------------------------:|
|    [1]{.yellow}  |     $\cat{low}$                 |    $\cat{high}$  |                             $\cat{headlamps}$  |
|    [2]{.yellow}  |     $\cat{low}$                 |  $\cat{medium}$  |  $\cat{building_windows_non_float_processed}$  |
|    [5]{.yellow}  |     $\cat{low}$                 |  $\cat{medium}$  |                             $\cat{headlamps}$  |
|    [7]{.yellow}  |     $\cat{low}$                 |  $\cat{medium}$  |  $\cat{building_windows_non_float_processed}$  |
|    [8]{.yellow}  |     $\cat{low}$                 |    $\cat{high}$  |                             $\cat{tableware}$  |
: Selection according to $\vCa\mo \cat{low}$ {#tbl-glass-ca-low .sm}

with conditional frequencies such as

$$
\begin{aligned}
&f(\vType\mo\cat{headlamps} \| \vCa\mo\cat{low}) = \frac{2}{5}
\\[1ex]
&f(\vType\mo\cat{tableware} \| \vCa\mo\cat{low}) = \frac{1}{5}
\end{aligned}
$$

and so on. The reverse is therefore *not* true: if $\vCa$ is equal to $\cat{low}$, that does *not* mean that it's impossible to observe other $\vType$ values besides $\cat{headlamps}$. Note especially how these frequencies differ:

$$
\begin{gathered}
f(\vCa\mo\cat{low} \| \vType\mo\cat{headlamps}) = 1
\\[1ex]
f(\vType\mo\cat{headlamps} \| \vCa\mo\cat{low}) = \frac{2}{5}
\end{gathered}
$$


In the original population we have, figuratively speaking, the following interesting association:

$$
\vType\mo \cat{headlamps}\ \mathrel{\green\Rightarrow}\ 
\vCa\mo \cat{low}
\qquad\text{\small but}\qquad
\vCa\mo \cat{low}\  \mathrel{\red\nRightarrow}\ 
\vType\mo \cat{headlamps}
$$

This kind of associations is often useful. Suppose for instance that you are asked to pick a unit with $\vCa$ equal to $\cat{low}$ in the original population; but it's difficult to measure a unit's $\vCa$ value, while it's easy to measure its $\vType$ value. Then you could instead search for a unit having $\vType$ equal to $\cat{headlamps}$ (easier search), and you would be sure that the unit you found also has $\vCa$ equal to $\cat{low}$.

\

The example above, where some values of a variate completely exclude some values of another, is a special one. More often we find that there are small or large changes in the frequency distribution of some variate, depending on the subpopulation considered.

:::{.callout-caution}
## {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise

- Calculate the (marginal) frequency distribution for the $\vCa$ variate for the glass-fragment population of [table @tbl-glass-simple]. Is the value $\cat{low}$ more frequent than $\cat{medium}$? or vice versa?

- Calculate the frequency distribution for $\vCa$, conditional on $\vType\mo\cat{tableware}$ (see [table @tbl-glass-tableware]). How does this frequency distribution differ from the one you calculated above? Come up with possible ways to exploit this difference in concrete applications.
:::

### Associations can be very counter-intuitive

It is usually best to assess associations by explicitly calculating all relevant conditional frequencies, rather than jumping to intuitive conclusions after having examined just a few. Here's an example.

\

Consider the statistical population defined as follows:

:::{.column-margin}
![](component_repair.jpg){width=100%}
:::

- *units:* all reparations done by a repair company on a particular kind of electronic components, which is extremely delicate and usually very difficult to repair. The population has 26 units (every unit actually represents a batch 100 reparations, so the population really refers to 2600 reparations).

- a joint *variate*, consisting in three binary ones:
    + $\vLoc$ of the repair procedure, with values $\oonsite$ and $\oremote$;
	
    + repair $\vMet$, with values $\oold$ and $\onew$, representing a traditional reparation method and one introduced more recently;
	
	+ $\vOut$ of the repair procedure, with values $\osuccess$ and $\ofailure$.


| $\vOut$     | $\vMet$ |    $\vLoc$ |
|:-------:|:---:|:------:|
| $\osuccess$ | $\oold$ | $\oonsite$ |
| $\ofailure$ | $\onew$ | $\oremote$ |
| $\ofailure$ | $\oold$ | $\oremote$ |
| $\ofailure$ | $\onew$ | $\oremote$ |
| $\ofailure$ | $\oold$ | $\oremote$ |
| $\ofailure$ | $\oold$ | $\oremote$ |
| $\osuccess$ | $\onew$ | $\oonsite$ |
| $\osuccess$ | $\oold$ | $\oremote$ |
| $\osuccess$ | $\onew$ | $\oonsite$ |
| $\osuccess$ | $\onew$ | $\oremote$ |
| $\osuccess$ | $\oold$ | $\oonsite$ |
| $\osuccess$ | $\oold$ | $\oonsite$ |
| $\ofailure$ | $\oold$ | $\oremote$ |
| $\osuccess$ | $\onew$ | $\oonsite$ |
| $\ofailure$ | $\onew$ | $\oonsite$ |
| $\ofailure$ | $\oold$ | $\oonsite$ |
| $\ofailure$ | $\oold$ | $\oremote$ |
| $\ofailure$ | $\oold$ | $\oremote$ |
| $\osuccess$ | $\onew$ | $\oonsite$ |
| $\osuccess$ | $\oold$ | $\oremote$ |
| $\osuccess$ | $\onew$ | $\oonsite$ |
| $\ofailure$ | $\onew$ | $\oremote$ |
| $\ofailure$ | $\onew$ | $\oremote$ |
| $\osuccess$ | $\onew$ | $\oonsite$ |
| $\osuccess$ | $\oold$ | $\oonsite$ |
| $\ofailure$ | $\onew$ | $\oonsite$ |
: Reparations (each row is one unit, representing 100 reparations).\
file [`repair_data.csv`](datasets/repair_data.csv) {#tbl-reparations .sm .striped}


**The repair company claims that, in this population, the $\onew$ repair method is more effective than the $\oold$.** Can you back up their claims?:

:::{.callout-caution}
## {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise (one of the most fun of the course!)

Use the population data above. The calculations can be done with any tools you like.

- Examine the whole population first:

    1. Calculate the frequency distribution of the $\vOut$ variate, conditional on $\vMet\mo\onew$ (note that we are disregarding the $\vLoc$).

    2. Calculate the frequency distribution of the $\vOut$ variate, conditional on $\vMet\mo\oold$.

    3. Compare the two conditional frequency distributions above. Which of the two repair methods seems more effective?\
	Are the claims of the repair company justified?


- Now examine the reparations that have been done $\oonsite$:

    4. Before doing any calculations, what do you expect to find? should the $\onew$ repair method be more effective than the $\oold$ one, for onsite reparations?

    5. Calculate the frequency distribution of the $\vOut$ variate, conditional on $\vMet\mo\onew$ and $\vLoc\mo\oonsite$.
	
    6. Calculate the frequency distribution of the $\vOut$ variate, conditional on $\vMet\mo\oold$ and $\vLoc\mo\oonsite$.
	
	7. Compare the two conditional frequency distributions for this $\oonsite$ case. Which of the two repair methods seems more effective?\
	How do you explain this result in the light of what you found in step 3.?

- Now examine the reparations that have been done $\oremote$ly:

    8. Before doing any calculations, what do you expect to find? should the $\onew$ repair method be more effective than the $\oold$ one, for reparations done remotely?

    9. Calculate the frequency distribution of the $\vOut$ variate, conditional on $\vMet\mo\onew$ and $\vLoc\mo\oremote$.
	
    10. Calculate the frequency distribution of the $\vOut$ variate, conditional on $\vMet\mo\oold$ and $\vLoc\mo\oremote$.
	
	11. Compare the two conditional frequency distributions for this $\oremote$ case. Which of the two repair methods seems more effective?\
	How do you explain this result in the light of what you found in steps 3. and 7.?


- Summarize and explain all your findings.\
    Can the repair company claim that the $\onew$ repair method is better than the $\oold$?\

- Suppose you need to send an electronic component for repair to this company.
    a. If you could choose both the $\vLoc$ and the $\vMet$ of the repair, which would you choose? why?
	
	b. If you could only choose the repair $\vMet$, but have no control over the $\vLoc$, which method would you choose? why?

	Is there other information, missing from the description of the population, that should be known before answering the questions above?
